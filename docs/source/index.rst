Welcome to TRINITY's documentation!
======================================

TRINITY is a python package that facilitates the modeling of HII region evolution and its physical structure.
Our Python package is designed to solve self-consistent equations of motion for a 1D spherical shell, evolving under the influence feedbacks such as stellar winds, injection of supernova energy and radiation pressure, with consideration of gravity.
