## SUMMARY (6 lines)

- **✅ 32 claims verified** | **⚠️ 6 minor drifts** (line-number drift only) | **❌ 0 factually wrong claims** | **❓ 1 doc-staleness gap**
- **The fix DID ship as described.** G (volume floor) is live at `trinity/bubble_structure/get_bubbleParams.py:228-235`; F (Eb≤0 clean stop) is live at `trinity/phase1_energy/run_energy_phase.py:340-351` (phase 1a try/except at :169-183) and `trinity/phase1b_energy_implicit/run_energy_implicit_phase.py:1007-1019`; `SimulationEndCode.ENERGY_COLLAPSED = (51,"energy_collapsed")` at `trinity/_output/simulation_end.py:90`. Shipped via PR #700 + PR #703 (merged 2026-06-19/22).
- **All three failing configs terminate cleanly with code 51; both healthy configs are byte-identical no-ops** — confirmed by `data/verify_extended_fix_all_configs.csv`.
- **Test suite:** `test/test_energy_collapse_guard.py` (77 lines, 6 test instances confirmed). Report claims "555 passed" — current suite has 574 collected (tests were added after the fix landed; that count was accurate at ship time).
- **Minor drift:** several line-number references in §8 are 1–27 lines off from current code (the try/except wrapper added to phase 1a pushed subsequent lines down); all logic references are correct.
- **❓ gap:** `docs/dev/misc/TERMINATION_EVENTS.md` (last verified 2026-06-16, before the fix) does not yet list `ENERGY_COLLAPSED` (code 51) — it predates the fix.

| Comment in `bubble_E2P` still reads "Catastrophic-cooling degeneracy" (report §9 says label was revised) | §9 / source | `get_bubbleParams.py:230`: comment says "Catastrophic-cooling degeneracy"; relabel commit `f63c0e9` only updated reason strings and `solve_R1` docstring, not this comment | ⚠️ minor | Optionally update comment to say "Eb→0 collapse" |
