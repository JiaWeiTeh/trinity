**Purpose.** This is the single map from **every result in the storyline** (the narrative is
`pdvtrigger_report.html` / `PLAN.md` / `FINDINGS.md`) to **the exact `.param` you run + the command + the
artifact it produces**. Use it to (a) re-run any piece for a paper, (b) prove the storyline is reproducible,
(c) know what is *cheap* (re-reads a committed CSV in seconds) vs *expensive* (a full sim, minutes–hours).

**Key fact for reproducibility.** `outputs/` is **git-ignored** (TRINITY writes runs there). So the **durable
record is the committed DERIVED CSV** in `data/`, not the raw run. Every figure is a *pure read* of a committed
CSV — so you can **rebuild every figure without running a single sim** (see [§Rebuild all figures](#rebuild-all-figures-no-sims)).
You only re-run the sims when you want to regenerate the underlying CSV from scratch.

## How to run one simulation
```bash
# from repo root. writes outputs/<path2output>/dictionary.jsonl + metadata.json + trinity.log
python run.py docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/runs/params/<name>.param
```
Each `.param` overrides only the keys it sets; everything else falls back to `trinity/_input/default.param`.
The `path2output` key inside each `.param` says where its run lands (all the calibration runs land in
`outputs/kcal/`).

## The two expensive blocks (🔴) — exact commands

### Block A — f_κ calibration grid (results #11, #13)
```bash
# 9 full runs: compact & diffuse at f_kappa in {1,2,4} (cooling_boost_kappa knob), default trigger
for c in compact diffuse; do for k in 1 2 4; do
  python run.py docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/runs/params/cal_${c}__k${k}.param
done; done
# 3 full runs: mid at f_kappa in {1,2,4} with ebpeak ACTIVE (cal_mid__ek{1,2,4})
for k in 1 2 4; do
  python run.py docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/runs/params/cal_mid__ek${k}.param
done
# 2 full runs: the dedicated ebpeak code-path test (transition_trigger=cooling_balance,ebpeak)
python run.py docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/runs/params/cal_compact__ebpeak.param
python run.py docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/runs/params/cal_diffuse__ebpeak.param
# then derive the committed CSVs + figures (cheap):
python docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/data/make_kappa_blowout_calibration.py
python docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/data/make_pdv_trigger_compare.py
python docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/data/make_ebpeak_trigger_test.py
```
Each `cal_*` run lands in `outputs/kcal/<model_name>/`. Compact/mid finish in minutes; **diffuse is slow**
(the `cal_diffuse__ebpeak` run goes to `stop_t=2.0`). For a clean single-variable density sweep on HPC, prefer
the array path — see **Block C** below (`runs/sync.sh` + `runs/run_fkappa.sbatch`), the worked Helix example.

### Block B — κ_eff back-reaction (result #9)
```bash
# separate processes + provenance, on the stiff dense edge:
python docs/dev/transition/harness/run_stamped.py docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/runs/params/f1edge_hidens__none.param
python docs/dev/transition/harness/run_stamped.py docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/runs/params/f1edge_hidens__kappa2.param
python docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/data/make_kappa_backreaction.py \
    outputs/pdvlive/f1edge_hidens__none/dictionary.jsonl \
    outputs/pdvlive/f1edge_hidens__kappa2/dictionary.jsonl
```

---

### Block C — controlled f_κ(n_H) calibration sweep (result #18; HPC, **RAN on Helix 2026-06-29** → artifacts committed, `data/fkappa_nH_sweep.csv`)
The clean replacement for the conflated 3-anchor estimate. Sweeps **nCore finely (primary axis) × a fine f_κ
grid** that brackets the firing point at every density, **and also varies mCloud + sfe** so we can test whether
`f_κ_fire` is a clean function of n_H alone or also depends on cloud mass / SFE.
**Grid = 7 nCore × 13 f_κ × 3 mCloud × 3 sfe = 819 combos** (HPC; under the 1000 ceiling).
Run it **reduce-then-plot** (the II-survey pattern): a committed, **pre-patched-for-Helix** array sbatch +
laptop driver (`runs/run_fkappa.sbatch`, `runs/sync.sh`) launch the grid; a **stdlib-only** reducer
(`data/reduce_fkappa_sweep.py`) walks the multi-GB jsonl ONCE on the cluster into a tiny `summary.csv`; only
that CSV crosses the wire, and the figure is fit/drawn on the laptop. The driver emits the bundle from
`/gpfs` so outputs land on the **writable** workspace, not the read-only `/home` repo checkout (the failure
mode a bare `sbatch jobs/submit_sweep.sbatch` from the repo hits).
```bash
# inspect anywhere (no cluster needed):
python run.py docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/runs/params/sweep_fkappa_nH.param --dry-run     # lists 819 combos

# on Helix, driven from the laptop (code travels by git pull; this folder is TRACKED):
./docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/runs/sync.sh submit    # git pull + emit to $WS/jobs_fkappa + sbatch array 1-819
./docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/runs/sync.sh watch     # tail the running array (+ squeue)
./docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/runs/sync.sh collect   # run.py --collect-report -> sweep_report.{txt,json}
./docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/runs/sync.sh reduce    # jsonl -> summary.csv  (ON HPC, stdlib-only, ~minutes)
./docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/runs/sync.sh down      # rsync summary.csv -> data/  (the tiny table, not jsonl)

# then on the laptop (no cluster): fit + de-conflation figure from summary.csv
python docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/data/make_fkappa_nH_sweep.py        # reads data/summary.csv
# (self-tests, no data: reduce_fkappa_sweep.py --selftest  · make_fkappa_nH_sweep.py --selftest)
```
Helix conventions baked in (same as II-survey / shellSSC6): `--partition=cpu-single --account=bw22J006
--export=NONE`, `module load devel/miniforge && conda activate trinity`, REPO `/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_cq295/trinity`,
WS `/gpfs/bwfor/work/ws/hd_cq295-trinity`. Validated: `--dry-run` expands to exactly 819 (zero plausibility
warnings); `--emit-jobs` produces a working SLURM array; the diffuse extreme (nCore 1e2) gives rCloud ≈ 39.6 pc
and the whole grid stays < the 200 pc `rCloud_max` ceiling (max is mCloud 1e7 × nCore 1e2 ≈ 70–85 pc). nCore is
**capped at 1e5** on purpose — 1e6 is pathologically stiff/slow (result #15), not f_κ-driven. The harness output
figure overlays the (mCloud, sfe) series: **collapse onto one curve ⇒ f_κ(n_H) is clean; spread ⇒ the
calibration is multi-dimensional.**

## Rebuild all figures (no sims) {#rebuild-all-figures-no-sims}
Every figure is a pure read of a committed CSV, so after a fresh clone you can regenerate the **whole
storyline's figures** without running TRINITY at all:
```bash
cd <repo root>
for h in doublecount_mc fmix_table fmix_spread_plot pdv_regime_table closure_test closure_plots \
         da_screen da_replay theta_density_plot fkappa_definition pdv_trigger_compare \
         ebpeak_trigger_test ebpeak_8config_xcheck fm1_rootcheck fm1b_evapsign \
         kappa_blowout_calibration ideas_comparison; do
  python docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/data/make_${h}.py || echo "SKIP $h (needs outputs/kcal — see Block A)"
done
python docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/make_pdvtrigger_report.py   # rebuild the HTML storyline
```
The ones that need a live run present in `outputs/kcal/` (#11, #13 derivations) will say so; everything else
rebuilds from the committed CSVs.

## Parameter knobs the storyline exercises (all gated, default-off)
| knob | default | sets which result |
|---|---|---|
| `cooling_boost_kappa` (f_κ) | `1.0` | #9, #11, #13 (the El-Badry conduction multiplier) |
| `cooling_boost_mode` / `_fmix` / `_theta` | `none` / `1.0` / `0.0` | #2, #8 (scalar multiplier / Lancaster-θ floor) |
| `transition_trigger` | `cooling_balance` | #13 (`ebpeak` opt-in) |
| `betadelta_solver` | `hybr` | #15 (hybr vs legacy) |

See the **Taxonomy** in `FINDINGS.md` / report §14 for what each knob means physically. **None of these
change a default run** — verified in `PLAN.md` (every experimental knob is off by default).
