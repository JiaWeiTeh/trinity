*Created 2026-07-01, when the pt2 line (merged via PR #717) and the parallel pt3 line
(`feature/transition-trigger-pt3`) were reconciled. Full audit provenance: four independent
re-reads of the docs, the code, and every committed artifact on that date.*

**Version/recency is a separate axis:** this register grades *quotability*; **`MANIFEST.md`** (generated,
`python make_manifest.py`) grades *currency* — per artifact, when it was last regenerated, by which script,
and whether its builder has changed since (⚠️ STALE-RISK). Check both before using any number.

## The rules that define "contaminated"

A result is **CONTAMINATED** if it violates any of (maintainer-authoritative; 📏 boxes in `PLAN.md`,
protocol in `runs/README.md`):

| rule | requirement | violation tag |
|---|---|---|
| **(a)** | every test run reaches **≥5 Myr** (or its natural physics end: recollapse, large_radius) | `<5Myr` |
| **(b)** | θ is reported as **θ_max over the run**, never at blowout | `blowout-θ` |
| **(c)** | θ is harvested from `dictionary.jsonl` accepted rows (`bubble_Lloss/Lmech_total`), never a call-level observer (solver trial (β,δ) points contaminate those — retraction **R6**, bogus θ_max=3.22) | `observer` |
| **(d)** | a calibration fit with one knob is only validated with the **same knob** (`cooling_boost_kappa` ≠ `multiplier` — retraction **R5**) | `knob-mismatch` |
| **(e)** | massive-cloud **fates** from **pre-PR#715** code (dead-stop on Eb≤0) are not quotable as physics | `pre-#715` |

Timeline of rule adoption (everything earlier is *retroactively* graded, i.e. flagged, not deleted):
PR #715 merged 2026-07-01 ~13:04 · rule (a) 2026-06-30 · rule (b) 2026-07-01 ~15:39 (`f125de6`) ·
rules (c)/(d) later on 2026-07-01 (FINDINGS §8d/§8e). The pt3-branch sweep work (2026-06-29 →
folded 2026-07-01) predates all of them.

## ⛔ DO NOT QUOTE (the headline list)

1. **F_KAPPA §14 "live validation" θ_max = 1.334 / 1.006 → "fires YES"** — `knob-mismatch` (fit on
   kappa, run with multiplier, R5) **and** `observer` (R6). Re-harvest from `dictionary.jsonl` before
   quoting anything from those runs.
2. **F_KAPPA §14 calibration table (θ₀, p, f_κ_ideal, θ@f_max, n_routeA boundaries)** — `blowout-θ`
   (θ₀ is a blowout snapshot) + fit on `cooling_boost_kappa` (does not carry over to `multiplier`,
   FINDINGS §8e) + the 6-anchor θ₀ slope (0.41/dex) was **falsified by the 819-sweep** (real 1.13/dex,
   PLAN scorecard P3 ❌). The *shape* of the argument survives; **no number in that table is production-grade**.
   Re-derived (2026-07-02) → `FINDINGS.md §10` / `runs/data/theta5_calibration.csv`.
3. **f_κ-to-fire ≈ 4 / 5–6 / 60 and the closed form f_κ(n_H) ≈ 1.4×10²·n^−0.30** (FINDINGS §6 + the
   06-29 "Calibration target" banner; `data/kappa_blowout_calibration.csv`,
   `data/kappa_calibration_estimate.csv`, `data/fkappa_functional_form.csv`) — `blowout-θ` + `<5Myr`
   (cal runs stop_t 0.3–1.0) + slope refuted by the sweep (−0.60) + superseded by the single-constant
   DECISION. Empirically refuted by theta5 (2026-07-02): diffuse f_fire = **4**, not 60 (the blowout metric
   had under-read diffuse θ by 2× — `FINDINGS.md §10`).
4. **The 63-cell `f_κ_fire` grid and everything derived from it** (`data/fkappa_nH_sweep.csv`,
   `data/summary.csv`, the θ₁-collapse fit `data/fkappa_theta1_collapse.csv`, and the shipped
   **`cooling_boost_kappa='auto'` lookup table** in `trinity/_input/fkappa_auto.py`) — `<5Myr`
   (sweep `stop_t=2`) and "fired-by-2-Myr" is not θ_max (rule b). Status: **PROVISIONAL, opt-in**,
   pending re-measurement under the standard protocol. The *de-conflation verdict* (f_κ ≠ f(n_H) alone)
   and the *θ₁-collapse law shape* are qualitative findings that likely survive; the grid **values** are not
   production-grade.
5. **All pre-PR#715 `fail_repro`/massive-cloud FATES** — `pre-#715`: FINDINGS §8/§8a
   SHELL_COLLAPSED conclusions (🛑-bannered in-doc), `data/shadow_te_fate.csv` fail_repro row,
   `data/sweep_tmax_fate.csv`, `runs/data/harvest_fail_repro__*.csv`, `runs/data/live_compare.csv`
   fail_repro row, `runs/README.md`'s "heavy clouds collapse regardless" verdict. The post-#715 record
   is `data/newcode_default_vs_theta.csv`.
6. **Any θ from the `_fkappa_validation_runner.py` observer** — `observer` (R6). The runner is kept
   as history; its θ numbers are void.

| `fA_source_boost{,_summary}.csv` (ran 07-06) | E8 | f_A source term (offline patch) | CLEAN as the **structural screen** (dial/sign/stability verdicts, G1/G2 gated); FLAG-(c)-adjacent for any θ quote: replayed frozen C0 states, NOT live runs, NOT ≥5 Myr θ_max — no fire threshold quotable (`FINDINGS.md §15` ⛔ note) |

NB the theta5b-only calibration CSV lacks θ₀ (no f=1 arms) — use the combined analysis |
| `theta5_fire_map.csv`, `theta5_law_check.csv`, `theta5b_{fire_map,law_check}.png` (built 07-02, `data/make_theta5b_analysis.py`) | E8 | — (re-reads both summaries) | CLEAN re-analysis (REPRODUCE #30): window [4,4.5], law rms 0.064 dex, DRAIN class = momentum-without-firing (do NOT count DRAIN as a θ transition) |

### `runs/data/`

| artifact | status |
|---|---|
| `harvest_simple_cluster__none.csv` | CLEAN (t→10.4 Myr) |

Two per-arm flags: `small_dense_highsfe__mult{4,8}` carry **NaN loss rows** (dense-edge stiffness — excluded from the fit); `midrange_pl0__mult8` reached momentum via the **Eb≤0 handoff, NOT a cooling fire** (`fired=False` is correct — do not count it as a θ transition). Stamp caveat: `theta5_summary.csv`'s stamp reads **`code 23f623d3+dirty`** — harvested on Helix from a dirty tree (the tree carried only the being-created CSVs, no code edits), noted per the `_stamp.py` doctrine |

### Production code (on this branch)

| item | status |
|---|---|
| `cooling_boost_mode` = `none` (default) / `multiplier` / `theta_target` | shipped, gated, default byte-identical; `theta_target` = documented opt-in override (demoted direction) |
| `cooling_boost_kappa` (numeric) | shipped, gated (×1.0 exact); **structural probe only** — breaks at f_κ=8 (§8e), raises evaporation |
| `cooling_boost_kappa = 'auto'` (pt3) | shipped, gated, opt-in; **PROVISIONAL** — lookup grid is E4-contaminated (see ⛔ #4); revalidate under the standard protocol before relying on it |
| `theta_elbadry` mode | **never merged** — docs/harness only (`THETA_ELBADRY_SPEC.md`) |
| PR #715 Eb≤0→momentum routing; Pb-collapse guard; `_MINT_LOG_TOL` log gate | shipped, behavior-verified |

## ⚡ Open + resolved tensions (while open, neither side is quotable as refuting the other)

1. **FINDINGS §8e vs §9 on `cooling_boost_kappa` — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-07-01, from committed data;
   `FINDINGS.md §9a`, `data/kappa_stability_map.csv`).** Both were right: the knob's breakdown is
   **non-monotonic in f_κ** (firing bands interleave with freeze windows; 17/57 cells non-monotonic,
   38/819 runs froze mid-implicit). The sweep's simple_cluster-analog cell freezes at f_κ=8/12 with
   θ_max=0.5331 — §8e's ~0.53, reproduced on Helix. Solver choice is ruled out (both ran default hybr).
   Fallout: kappa even less shippable; `'auto'` gains an interpolation-into-a-dead-window caveat.
2. **`'auto'` (fire everything, per-cloud f_κ) vs the maintainer decisions** "single physical f_κ
   constant" + route-a ("diffuse clouds may never enter momentum"). 'auto' stands as an opt-in
   convenience, not the production direction.
3. **θ-peak epoch (updated 2026-07-02):** config-dependent, and the diffuse peak sits at the very **EDGE**
   of the 5 Myr window. theta5 (`FINDINGS.md §10`) measured the diffuse baseline peak at **t≈4.9 Myr**
   (large_diffuse θ₀=0.535), and `large_diffuse_lowsfe__mult2` **grazes 0.9552 exactly at stop_t=5** — so
   the 5 Myr window may NOT fully cover the diffuse peak. Earlier anchors (PLAN 📏 rule 1 "~0.4–1 Myr";
   SESSION_HANDOFF §5.2 "~blowout"; measured compact 0.912 @ t≈0.12, diffuse 0.862 @ t≈1.06) stand as
   history. **Open residue: the stop_t=8 diffuse spot-check**, which would bracket the diffuse f_fire
   between 2 and 4.

## Addendum 2026-07-19 — HPC-era rows (theta5s / bench5 / bench6)

| artifact | grade | note |
|---|---|---|
| `runs/data/theta5s_summary.csv` + `data/theta5s_{fire_map,collapse_law}.csv` | ✅ QUOTABLE (HPC) | Helix harvest 2026-07-19; p=3.330 reproduced exactly (`FINDINGS §15e/§15j`). `data/theta5s_dmdt_suppression.csv` alone still in-container-derived — do not quote a dMdt number until re-derived on Helix raw arms. |
| `runs/data/bench5_summary_hpc.csv` + `bench5_traj_hpc/` + `data/bench5_analysis.csv` | ✅ QUOTABLE (HPC) | fidelity vs in-container measured (zero fire flips; 57/60 <0.05); dense-bench Θ_cum stays collapse-window (NOT the clean L21b metric) — quote band numbers from bench3/2/1 only. In-container pair retained as the fidelity-comparison evidence. |
| `runs/data/bench6_summary.csv` + `bench6_traj/` + `data/bench6_analysis.csv` | ✅ QUOTABLE (HPC) | f_mix FIRE thresholds carry the §16 fallback double-boost caveat (can only flatter f_mix); Θ_cum trends are accepted-row and unaffected (`FINDINGS §15j`). |
