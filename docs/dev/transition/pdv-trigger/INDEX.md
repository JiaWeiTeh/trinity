## 0. What this workstream is (one paragraph)

TRINITY transitions a feedback bubble from **energy-driven** to **momentum-driven** when interface cooling drains
the mechanical luminosity (the `cooling_balance` trigger at θ = L_cool/L_mech ≥ 0.95 — the default
`transition_trigger`, threshold `phaseSwitch_LlossLgain=0.05`). This workstream asks: *what sets θ, what raises it
to the obs/3D values (Lancaster θ~0.9–0.99), and how does it depend on cloud properties?* TRINITY's native 1-D
θ under-shoots that band for most clouds, so realistic GMCs never fire the trigger — that is **the problem**.
**Current direction (corrected 2026-07-01):** θ is an **OUTPUT, not an input** — boost the cooling **mechanism**
and let the solved bubble produce θ, with El-Badry's closed form θ(λδv, n) and Lancaster's 0.9–0.99 band as the
**calibration target**; use a **single physical f constant** (not f(n)); **accept route-a** (→ nuanced 2026-07-02: theta5 showed the
canonical diffuse GMC *fires* at f_mix=4; route-a = `small_1e6` + `fail_repro`, a **θ₀-set** boundary, not a
density-set one — §10); massive/PdV clouds ride the PR #715 `Eb≤0→momentum` handoff. The tentative mechanism knob is
**`cooling_boost_mode='multiplier'`** (stable, radiative-only) — **its calibration was re-derived 2026-07-02**
(the 📏 theta5 matrix on Helix; `FINDINGS.md §10`, `runs/data/theta5_calibration.csv`): θ₁-collapse law
**f_fire ≈ 1.4·(0.95/θ₀)^1.82**, and **f_mix=4 fires the whole normal-GMC band** — **f_mix = 4 ADOPTED
(2026-07-02 maintainer ruling: momentum-then-recollapse is acceptable physics)**; theta5b refines the
workable window for the referee statement. The earlier θ₀/p had been fit
on the *other* knob, `cooling_boost_kappa`, which breaks down at f_κ=8 (FINDINGS §8e).
*History:* PdV question → f_κ Rung-A → structural κ_mix Rung-B (**shelved**, saturates) → impose-El-Badry-θ
detour (**demoted to opt-in**, double-counts PdV) → emergent-θ correction + knob correction (2026-07-01) →
**merged the parallel pt3 line** (819-run sweep θ₁-collapse law + `cooling_boost_kappa='auto'`, **PROVISIONAL**)
→ **theta5 matrix ran** (2026-07-02, §10).
Production changes to date (all gated/behavior-neutral): `cooling_boost_{mode,fmix,theta,kappa}` (+ pt3 `'auto'`
resolver), PR #715 handoff, Pb-collapse guard, `_MINT_LOG_TOL` log gate.

## 1. Read in this order (orientation) — updated 2026-07-01 (post pt2+pt3 reconciliation)

1. **this file** — the map (incl. the §1.5 staleness audit below).
2. **`CONTAMINATION.md`** — ⛔ what you may and may not quote (rules (a)–(e), the full artifact register,
   the §8e-vs-§9 tension resolution). **Read before quoting ANY number from this workstream.**
   **+ `MANIFEST.md`** — *which version is this file?* Generated ledger (`python make_manifest.py`): per
   artifact, last-updated date + commit, its producing script, and a ⚠️ STALE-RISK flag whenever a builder
   changed after its committed output (an output from an older builder version). Recency ≠ quotability —
   use MANIFEST for "is this current?", CONTAMINATION for "may I quote it?". **Regenerate the manifest in
   the same commit as any artifact change.**
3. `PLAN.md` → the **⭐⭐ CANONICAL SYNTHESIS + VERDICT** block (the current direction; supersedes all earlier
   synthesis) + the dated status ledger (newest first).
4. `FINDINGS.md` §8c (why enforce-θ was demoted), §8e (knob validation: kappa breaks; multiplier tentative),
   §9 (the pt3 819-sweep + θ₁-collapse law + 'auto', with post-merge flags), **§10 (the theta5 matrix,
   ran 2026-07-02 — the current headline result)**.
5. `ELBADRY_REFERENCE.md` + `LANCASTER_REFERENCE.md` — 📌 the two **imprint** reference docs (θ definition, the
   closed form, λδv≈3, the n-mapping, PdV) — the **calibration target** for emergent θ, not an enforced value.
6. `runs/README.md` **📏 STANDARD PROTOCOL** — the 8-config × ≥5 Myr × θ_max harness every new claim runs through.
7. `REPRODUCE.md` — result → `.param`/command → artifact manifest.

## 1.5 ⚠️ STALENESS AUDIT — docs that describe SUPERSEDED directions (read before trusting a conclusion)

The direction was **corrected on 2026-07-01** back to **emergent θ via a mechanism boost** (calibrate to
El-Badry/Lancaster) after the intermediate "**impose** El-Badry's θ" avenue (2026-06-30) was shown to
double-count PdV on massive clouds (`FINDINGS.md §8b/§8c`). The same day, the **KNOB CORRECTION** voided the
§14 validation (fit on `kappa`, run with `multiplier`) and §8e broke the `kappa` knob at f_κ=8. Several docs
predate one or more of these pivots and, read in isolation, point the wrong way. **Kept for provenance, flagged here:**

| doc | what's STALE in it | the correct current view |
|---|---|---|
| any doc/banner saying **"impose El-Badry θ as the trigger target"** is the direction (incl. earlier revisions of `PLAN.md`, `FINDINGS.md` taxonomy banner, `THETA_ELBADRY_SPEC.md` framing) | the *enforce-θ* framing | **demoted to an opt-in override** (2026-07-01) — it double-counts PdV (`FINDINGS.md §8b/§8c`). Direction = **emergent θ**, El-Badry as calibration target. |
| `F_KAPPA_FUNCTIONAL_FORM.md` **§14 numbers** (θ₀, p, f_κ_ideal, n_routeA; the θ_max=1.334/1.006 "validation") | blowout-θ₀ + kappa-fit + contaminated observer | **no §14 number is production-grade** (`CONTAMINATION.md` ⛔ #1–#2); the *program* (emergent θ, physical cap, route-a) stands; **re-derived 2026-07-02 → `FINDINGS.md §10` / `runs/data/theta5_calibration.csv`** |
| `FINDINGS.md` mid-doc "→ Calibration target (2026-06-29)" banner (f_κ(n_H)≈1.4×10²·n^−0.30; 48/9/3) | pre-sweep slope + pre-DECISION f_κ(n) framing | slope measured −0.60 (scorecard P1 ❌); superseded by the **single-constant DECISION** + the §9 θ₁-collapse law |
| `KAPPA_VALIDATION_PLAN.md` | its banner called the §8e⇄§9 kappa result an "**open tension with FINDINGS §9**" (⚡ #1) | that tension was **RESOLVED same-day** (`FINDINGS.md §9a`, `data/kappa_stability_map.csv`: non-monotonic breakdown windows); banner updated 2026-07-02. (Earlier staleness — "T3 ⏳ running", the 0.99/0.91/0.55 column mislabelled "the multiplier predictions" — was already fixed in-doc: T1–T5 all DONE; that column is the §14 **kappa-fit model** prediction, the multiplier runs the invalid (R5) *validation*.) |
| `SESSION_HANDOFF_2026-07-01.md` | frozen speculation snapshot (its own 🚨 banner); §5.2 re-anchors the θ peak on "~blowout" | historical record of the pt2 session — do not mine it for numbers; θ-peak epoch is config-dependent (`CONTAMINATION.md` ⚡ #3) |
| `RUNGB_SCOPING.md` | the **structural κ_mix injection** ("re-promoted", §8 gated production) as the path | the structural port is **SHELVED** (saturates/unstable, `KMIX_SELFCONSISTENT.md`); κ_mix survives only as physical *justification* for θ∝√(λδv·n) |
| `KMIX_SELFCONSISTENT.md` §2 | "dense θ plateaus low (~0.35) / only 1/6 fires" | **WALKED BACK** — wrong epoch (blowout) + buggy port; El-Badry+Lancaster agree **dense θ is HIGH (0.9–0.99)**. See §2b and `LANCASTER_REFERENCE.md` §7. |
| `KMIX_DIFFUSIVITY.md` / `KMIX_PROTOTYPE.md` | "calibrate λδv to Lancaster (value open)"; prototype Pb anchors from **0.3–1.0 Myr truncated** runs | **λδv≈3 is now pinned** (`LANCASTER_REFERENCE.md` §7); re-derive prototype Pb from ≥5 Myr runs before quoting numbers |
| `KMIX_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` | the κ_mix-into-the-ODE wiring design | **SHELVED** (banner in the doc); its dimensionless-multiplier *units* strategy is still reusable |
| `runs/README.md` §9-era verdicts | "heavy clouds collapse regardless" (fail_repro) | **pre-PR#715** dead-stop artifact — post-merge record is `data/newcode_default_vs_theta.csv` |
| any "Lancaster 2021c / ApJ 914, 91" / "ApJ 914,90 = theory" | paper-ID confusion | ApJ 914, **90 is Paper II (sims)** — the θ~0.9–0.99 anchor; see `LANCASTER_REFERENCE.md` §0 |

**Rule going forward (maintainer): whenever a decision is made, update the ⭐⭐ canonical synthesis AND this
audit AND `CONTAMINATION.md` AND the affected sibling together — never one in isolation.**

contamination guard this workstream inherits.
Shared tooling: `../harness/` (`run_stamped.py` provenance-stamped launcher, `harvest.py` P0 trigger harvester);
the canonical 8-config base params live in `../cleanroom/configs/` (6) + `runs/make_theta5_params.py` (all 8).

## 3. The live thread — close the calibration loop on the RIGHT knob (updated 2026-07-01)

**Hard guardrail (maintainer): no production change before testing all 8 configs (📏 protocol: ≥5 Myr,
θ_max, separate processes).** The 8: `simple_cluster`, `midrange_pl0`, `be_sphere`, `pl2_steep`,
`large_diffuse_lowsfe`, `small_dense_highsfe` (6 cleanroom) + `fail_repro` (heavy 5e9) + `small_1e6` (control).

## 4. Data & figures

~50 builders + ~45 CSVs + ~45 figures under `data/`, `runs/data/` and the folder root. The canonical map is
**`REPRODUCE.md`** (result #1–#28 → builder/param/command/artifact); the quotability of every artifact is graded
in **`CONTAMINATION.md`** (do not quote a number without checking it there first). The HPC artifacts are the
819-combo sweep (`data/summary.csv` + reduction) and the 📏 `theta5` matrix (ran 2026-07-02;
`runs/data/theta5_{summary,calibration}.csv`).
