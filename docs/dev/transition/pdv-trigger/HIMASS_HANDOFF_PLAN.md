## 1. Problem (verified against current source, 2026-06-30)

A massive/dense cloud loses the bubble's thermal energy faster than it can build it up, so `Eb`
turns over and falls through zero **inside the explicit energy phase (1a)**. There, the guard

```python
# trinity/phase1_energy/run_energy_phase.py:340
if not np.isfinite(Eb) or Eb <= 0:
    params['EndSimulationDirectly'].value = True   # SimulationEndCode.ENERGY_COLLAPSED (51)
    ... break
```

sets `EndSimulationDirectly=True`, which **no-ops phases 1b, 1c, AND 2** (each is gated
`if params['EndSimulationDirectly'].value == False`, `main.py:283,303,343`). The run stops dead at
`ENERGY_COLLAPSED` instead of continuing as a momentum-driven bubble. **That dead-stop is the bug.**

### What is NOT the mechanism (corrected diagnosis)
- The default `transition_trigger` is **`cooling_balance`** (`default.param:282`), not `ebpeak`.
  `ebpeak` (`edot_balance ≤ 0`, PdV-inclusive) is **opt-in and shadow-only** — logged, never drives the
  switch (`run_energy_implicit_phase.py:199-212,1167-1205`). So "massive clusters cool via `ebpeak`" is
  **false**; they die at the `Eb<=0` guard in 1a, often before 1b's triggers are ever evaluated.
- The collapse is **not** radiative-cooling-dominated. The committed decomposition
  (`data/pdv_regime_budget.csv`) shows, normalised by `Lmech`:

  | config | PdV/Lmech (med, max) | radiative Lloss/Lmech | Eb turns over? |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 6 normal configs | 0.43–0.46, ≤0.70 | 0.17–0.29 | no (Eb grows 1500–2400×) |
  | small_1e6 (dense ctrl) | 0.55, **1.10** | **0.022** | **yes (PdV>Lmech)** |
  | fail_repro (5e9 massive) | **1.42, 1.56** | **0.0085** | **yes (PdV≫Lmech)** |

  In every config **PdV ≥ radiative loss**, and for the configs that actually turn over, PdV exceeds
  `Lmech` while radiative cooling is negligible. The massive-cloud turnover is **PdV / inertial-loading
  driven** (heavy shell soaks up the wind energy as bulk motion; the hot, tenuous bubble interior barely
  radiates), not radiative-cooling driven. This **vindicates the original intuition** and **contradicts**
  the external "it's `L_bubble`, not PdV" analysis. See `FINDINGS.md` §1, §6a.

### Why `Eb→0` is the wrong trigger point (this part of the external analysis is correct)
At collapse the energy-driven structure is singular: `solve_R1` drives `R1→R2`, so
`shell_volume = R2³−R1³ → 0` and `bubble_E2P = (γ−1)Eb/V → 0/0 → nan`
(`get_bubbleParams.py:229-235,421-426`). Triggering the handoff exactly there asks the model to switch
from its single most ill-conditioned state.

### Key identity (current code, numerically verified 2026-06-30)
Because `R1=solve_R1(R2,Eb,…)` satisfies `R2³−R1³ = R1²·v_mech·Eb/Lmech`, the `Eb` in `bubble_E2P`
**cancels**:

```
Pb  = (γ−1)·Lmech / [(4π/3)·R1²·v_mech]                 (Eb enters only via R1)
PdV/Lmech = 2 (R2/R1)² (v2/v_mech)            [γ=5/3]
```

So `Pb ∝ Eb` holds **only while R1≪R2** (high Eb); as `Eb→0`, `R1→R2` and `Pb` **floors** (it does not
go to zero), and `PdV/Lmech → 2(v2/v_mech)`. The external analysis's premise `press_bubble ∝ Eb` and its
"PdV is a self-damping term that can't push Eb negative" both fail in the collapse regime. Verification
harness to re-run: see §6 (a ~1-second script, no full sim).

## 2. Fix concept — trigger on the pressure crossover, route into the existing 1c→2 chain

The handoff machinery **already exists** and is exactly what the physics wants:
- **Phase 1c (transition):** decays `Eb` using `P_drive = max(Pb, P_HII + P_ram)`
  (`run_transition_phase.py:331`), with a terminal event at `Eb < ENERGY_FLOOR = 1e3` (`:766`).
- **Phase 2 (momentum):** sets `Eb = 0` and drives on ram pressure only (`run_momentum_phase.py:511`).

The energy-driven phase is *done* — physically — when thermal driving has decayed to the momentum
level, i.e. the **pressure crossover**

```
Pb  ≲  P_HII + P_ram                  (θ→ the momentum-driving pressure, seen from the pressure side)
```

At that point `P_drive = max(Pb, P_HII+P_ram)` is continuous by construction, so the velocity ODE does
not jump across the switch. This is well-defined while `Eb` is small-but-finite, so we never enter the
`0/0` region.

### Design (smallest change that removes the dead-stop)
1. **Detect the crossover in the explicit phase (1a).** Add a `solve_ivp` **terminal event**
   `g(t,y) = press_bubble(Eb,R2,R1) − (P_HII + P_ram)` (terminal, `direction=-1`) in
   `run_energy_phase.py`, alongside the existing events. Root-finding on the dense-output interpolant
   locates the crossing inside the step (no reliance on `Eb` landing near zero → no overshoot problem).
2. **Make the RHS finite at an overshot trial point** so the root-finder can bracket: clamp
   `press_bubble = max(0.0, bubble_E2P(...))` and confirm `solve_R1` already returns finite for
   `Eb≤0` / `R2≤0` (it does — `:431-434`). This is the only change to the hot RHS and must clear the
   bit-identical gate on healthy bubbles (the clamp is a no-op when `Pb>0`).
3. **Route, don't stop.** On the crossover event, end phase 1a *normally* (do NOT set
   `EndSimulationDirectly`), carrying `(R2, v2, Eb)` so `main.run_expansion` proceeds into 1c→2 exactly
   as a `cooling_balance` transition does today. Keep `EndSimulationDirectly` + `ENERGY_COLLAPSED` only
   for genuine endings (rCloud, dissolution, stop_t) — never for the energy→momentum transition.
4. **Open question — 1c vs straight-to-momentum.** If the crossover fires essentially at ignition (the
   stillborn massive cloud, `A<0` from birth, PdV-starved), there is no energy epoch for 1c's `Eb`-decay
   to walk out of; routing straight to momentum is the honest representation. If a meaningful energy
   epoch remains, go through 1c. **Decide by measurement** (§5), not assumption — default to the
   lower-risk "always through 1c" unless 1c is shown to be ill-conditioned at near-zero `Eb`.

> Scope guard: this is a **solver-edge** change (rule 5 / planning protocol "risky"). The diff should be
> confined to (a) one terminal event + clamp in `run_energy_phase.py`, (b) the routing branch, and (c) an
> analogous crossover handling in 1b if 1a hands off to 1b first. No new params, no κ_eff coupling, no
> touching `cooling_balance`/`ebpeak`.

## 3. Equivalence gates (define BEFORE editing — rule 5)

- **G0 — bit-identical on healthy bubbles.** On configs whose energy phase does NOT collapse
  (`param/simple_cluster.param`, `docs/dev/performance/f1edge_lowdens*.param`), the new event +
  `max(0.0, Pb)` clamp must be a **no-op**: value-diff vs `git show HEAD` AND byte-identical
  `dictionary.jsonl`, full runs in separate processes at matched `t`. The clamp only changes behaviour
  when `Pb≤0`, which a healthy bubble never reaches.
- **G1 — single-step continuity at the crossover.** At the located event time, `P_drive` and `vd` from
  the energy-phase RHS equal those from the transition-phase RHS to tolerance (necessary, not
  sufficient).
- **G2 — full-run handoff on the stiff edge.** On a genuinely collapsing config (the dense/heavy edge —
  `small_dense_highsfe`, and a heavy-mass case in the `fail_repro`/5e9 family), the run must continue
  past the old `ENERGY_COLLAPSED` point into momentum and reach a physical stopping fate (rCloud /
  dissolution / stop_t), with `R2(t)`, `v2(t)` continuous across the switch. Separate processes, matched
  `t`.
- **G3 — regression.** Full `pytest` green + ruff F-rules. Add a focused `test_*.py`: a collapsing config
  must end on a momentum/stopping fate, NOT `ENERGY_COLLAPSED` — the failing-test-first for this bug.

## 4. Baseline to capture before editing
- `git show HEAD` values + byte hash of `dictionary.jsonl` for the G0 configs.
- The current `ENERGY_COLLAPSED` trajectory (R2,v2,Eb,t at the stop) for the stiff-edge configs, saved as
  a committed CSV under `data/` — this is the "before" the handoff is measured against.

## 5. Measurement to settle the 1c-vs-momentum question (§2.4)
Replay the crossover point on the existing frozen trajectories (no full re-run): at the located
`Pb=P_HII+P_ram` time, report `Eb/Eb_peak`, `R1/R2`, and remaining energy epoch length. If
`Eb/Eb_peak ≲ few %` and `R1/R2→1` at the crossover (stillborn), route straight to momentum; else 1c.
Persist as `data/crossover_epoch.csv`.

## 6. Reproduce the §1 identity check (no sim, ~1 s)
```
python3 - <<'PY'
import numpy as np, trinity.bubble_structure.get_bubbleParams as gp
R2,Lmech,vmech,g,v2 = 5.0,1e4,3000.0,5/3,30.0
for Eb in [1e6,1e3,1e0,1e-3]:
    R1=gp.solve_R1(R2,Eb,Lmech,vmech); Pb=gp.bubble_E2P(Eb,R2,R1,g)
    print(f'Eb={Eb:.0e} R2/R1={R2/max(R1,1e-9):7.2f} Pb/Eb={Pb/Eb:.3e} PdV/Lmech={4*np.pi*R2**2*Pb*v2/Lmech:.4f}')
PY
```
Expected: `Pb/Eb` constant at high Eb (Pb∝Eb), blows up as Eb→0 (Pb floors); `PdV/Lmech` falls
1200→1.2→0.02. Confirms `Pb` is NOT ∝ Eb near collapse.

## 7. Risks
- Trinity leaks module-level global state in-process → all equivalence runs MUST be separate processes
  at matched `t` (CLAUDE.md rule 5).
- numpy pinned `<2`; the monotonic guard in the bubble integrator is fragile — do not bump.
- If 1a hands to 1b before the crossover, the same crossover handling is needed in
  `run_energy_implicit_phase.py`; check which phase the collapse actually occurs in per config before
  deciding where the event lives.
