## Re-entry ledger — open this FIRST (the 🔄 banner, operationalized)

The recheck list the banners demand. **Every visit:** re-verify the anchors below, update the ledger,
*then* read on. All findings here are **already persisted** (CSVs + figures under `data/` and this
folder) — do **not** re-run the hours-long sims to recover them; reproduce only to extend.

**Status ledger (newest first):**
- **2026-06-26 (later) — `κ_eff` Rung B scoped on paper (`RUNGB_SCOPING.md`), no code touched.** Two
  independent verifications (IC algebra + cooling/evaporation decoupling, both adversarially checked vs
  current source; the front-balance identity confirmed to machine precision). Headline finding: in the
  Weaver solve the conductive flux `q=κ·dT/dr` at the front is **one quantity read twice** (fixes `dMdt`
  via the enthalpy balance *and* sets the radiating profile) — which is *why* Rung A raised both together,
  and why a faithful `κ_eff` must **sever `dMdt` from the front balance** (entrainment-set, `>0` by
  construction) rather than swap `κ`. The mix-branch near-front IC is **numerical** (`κ_mix∝1/T ⇒ p=−1 ⇒
  q=−1` is not front-regular); `κ_mix`'s magnitude needs an entrainment efficiency `α_mix≪1` (literal
  `D_turb=R2·v2` ⇒ `T_cross~10¹²` K, absurd) — *that factor is the model*. `dMdt>0` safety threads the
  cleanroom §6.6 trap because `dMdt` becomes an input, not a root. `(β,δ)` solver untouched (no
  conduction-law dependence; its `dMdt>0` gate + `bubble_LTotal` use are the coupling surfaces). Next
  concrete step is on-paper risk #1 (what `v(R1)=0` solves for) — still no production edit.
- **2026-06-26 — `κ_eff` Rung A executed (back-reaction probe, gated/byte-identical-off).** Added
  `cooling_boost_kappa` (`f_κ`, default 1.0) multiplying the Spitzer coefficient `C_thermal` at all 3
  bubble-structure sites (`bubble_luminosity.py:291/:370/:406`). **Gate passed:** byte-identical when
  `f_κ=1` (sha `acbad31b`, 79 rows of `f1edge_hidens`), diverges when `f_κ=2`; full `pytest` 595 green
  (the `test_dR2min_magic_number.py::_scalar_params` minimal fixture patched to carry the neutral key),
  ruff F-rules clean. **Crux measured** (`data/make_kappa_backreaction.py`, `data/kappa_backreaction.csv`,
  `kappa_backreaction.png`): at matched `t`, `f_κ=2` raises `Lcool` ×1.23–1.38 (cooling rises *through the
  structure*, θ as an output) **but `dMdt` ×1.08–1.17 rides along** — the El-Badry coupling a faithful
  `κ_eff` must instead suppress. A `2×` κ buys only **+0.05–0.10** loss-ratio toward the 0.95 trigger ⇒
  brute-`f_κ` is non-viable, **confirming Rung B is required, not optional**. Details: `KAPPA_EFF_SCOPING.md`
  §6a. **Production unchanged** — `cooling_boost_kappa` defaults to 1.0 (opt-in, byte-identical off).
- **2026-06-25 (late) — Cooling-boost program CONCLUDED; PLAN re-validated line-by-line.** Completed the
  diffuse arm (`f1edge_lowdens` ×2/×3 → **4/4 live configs**; `runs/data/live_compare.csv`) — no constant
  fires across density. Put the coupled `θ_target(Da)` on trial: offline Da-screen **NO-GO** + a
  **gate-validated real-Da replay** (`data/make_da_replay.py`; reproduces logged `bubble_Lloss` to ≤3.9e-5,
  interface L3 bit-identical) → **`θ_target(Da)` REFUTED** (T_int ~const ⇒ real Da ≈ proxy; Da≫1 everywhere ⇒
  `θmax·Da/(1+Da)` saturates to a constant; non-monotonic in nCore). Live `theta_target` validation: the
  literature θ (0.9–0.99) **straddles** the 0.95 trigger threshold ⇒ a scalar can't separate magnitude from
  triggering. **Pivot (§Outcome & pivot):** for normal clouds **blowout is the transition trigger**; the
  cooling boost corrects *magnitude*; `κ_eff` is the scoped endgame (`KAPPA_EFF_SCOPING.md`, feasible/bounded).
  **Re-validation:** all 8 offline screens re-ran **byte-identical**, the real-Da replay re-passed its gate,
  20/20 tests green; code line-refs corrected (`Edot_from_balance :434→:475`; trigger `:1200→:1206`;
  shadow/drive drifts) and the stale `f1edge_lowdens "NOT run"` reconciled. See `FINDINGS.md`.
- **2026-06-25 — LIVE matched-t edge runs (3/4 configs) DONE; a constant f=2 over/under-shoots by density.**
  Ran `none` vs `multiplier f=2` for hidens (dense), simple_cluster (compact), fail_repro (heavy) in
  separate processes (provenance clean, `commit=6642ff4, dirty=False, rc=0`; persisted `runs/data/live_compare.csv`
  + 6 harvest trajectories). Findings: hidens f=2 fires cooling **at birth** (t=0.0034, before blowout —
  over-boost); simple_cluster f=2 fires **just after** blowout (t=0.131 vs blowout 0.109) with a large live
  trajectory shift (Eb −47%, v2 −44%, R2 −15% → **frozen screen insufficient, confirmed**); fail_repro
  collapses identically with/without boost (cooling doesn't rescue heavy clouds — control confirmed). ⇒
  **no constant f_mix fits the density grid** → confirms the coupled `θ_target(n)=θ_lit(n)` direction
  (calibrate to the literature loss fraction, NOT to the 0.95 trigger threshold — the latter is circular).
  Diffuse `f1edge_lowdens` was not run *in this batch* (worktree mis-fork from `main` + a ~55–60 min env
  wall-cap on background runs) — **but was run later the same day (×2/×3; 4/4 configs total); see the top
  ledger entry and `runs/data/live_compare.csv`.** See `runs/README.md` §Live results.
- **2026-06-24 (pm) — Verified the maintainer's revised note line-by-line against source + screen data.**
  Code anchors all **confirmed** (Eq.1 ODE = `get_betadelta.py:475`; trigger = `(Lgain−Lloss)/Lgain<0.05`
  radiative-only `:1206`; no boost knob in `trinity/`). My screen numbers **reproduce exactly**. Found and
  fixed: (a) **trigger-convention bug** — the note's Table 2 headline `f_mix≈1.1–1.5` is the *with-PdV*
  screen, inconsistent with the note's own *no-PdV* recommended trigger; consistent value is
  **`f_mix≈1.4–2.8`** (`data/fmix_table.csv`, both conventions); (b) the **5×10⁵-draw** double-count claim
  had no committed script → added `data/make_doublecount_mc.py`+`doublecount_mc.csv` (0 draws enter the
  region); (c) Table 2 now script-emitted (`data/make_fmix_table.py`). Literature values farmed out to a
  web-verify pass (separate). **Then started Task B** — wiring opt-in `cooling_boost_mode` (gated,
  byte-identical when off) for the live test. See §"Task B".
- **2026-06-24** — Folded in the maintainer's Paper-II interface-cooling note (`f_mix` *multiplier* vs
  `θ_target` *fraction*; **boost the loss, not the trigger**; one `Lloss_eff` in three places; `κ_eff`
  endgame) — §Refined plan. Ran the **8-config staged shadow** (frozen trajectory) → §Stage results.
  **Verdict so far:** normal clouds want a *cooling boost* (`f_mix≈1.5–2` lands the ratio near the
  transition); heavy 5e9 wants the *PdV/`ebpeak`* handoff — a clean sub/super-critical split. A *constant*
  knob can't place the transition at blowout across the density grid (θ_at_blowout spans 1.1→3.1) ⇒ points
  to the coupled `θ_target(Da)`/`κ_eff` form. **Production still unchanged** (grep-confirmed, anchor 3).
- **2026-06-23** — Scoped the maintainer's "PdV in the trigger" question. "PdV negligible" is false
  (`PdV/Lmech` median 0.43–0.55); the real fork is `PdV/Lmech ≷ 1`. Offline-tested **reading B**
  (`(Lmech−Lloss−PdV)/Lmech<0.05`) → fails as a usable trigger; recommended **reading A** (`ebpeak`).
  All offline from already-committed per-step CSVs.

**Decision RESOLVED (maintainer said go, 2026-06-24):** the opt-in `cooling_boost_mode ∈
{none, multiplier, theta_target}` wiring is **implemented and gated** — byte-identical when `none`
(confirmed through the active-cooling region), `multiplier f=2` diverges at the first active-cooling step.
See **§Task B**. **Open next step:** the matched-`t` edge-config **live** runs (boosted vs unboosted,
separate processes) that replace the frozen screen and settle constant-`f_mix` vs `θ_target(Da)`.

**Re-verify these load-bearing anchors on entry** (re-validated line-by-line 2026-06-25 — all 8 offline
screens reproduce byte-identical, real-Da replay re-passed its gate, 20/20 tests green; line-refs below corrected):
1. **PdV at 3 sites** (§Where PdV lives) — ODE `run_energy_implicit_phase.py:847-848`
   (`residual_Edot2_guess ← betadelta_result.Edot_from_balance`); `cooling_balance` trigger `:1206`
   (radiative, **no** PdV); `ebpeak` shadow `evaluate_r1_shadow():198-211` + drive `:1198-1204`.
2. **Opt-in is byte-identical** — `transition_trigger` default `cooling_balance` (`registry.py:347`,
   `default.param:282`); a non-default token only *drives* the R1 handoff, never perturbs a default run.
3. **Cooling boost knob has LANDED in production (2026-06-25, supersedes the 2026-06-24 "production
   untouched").** `grep -rn 'cooling_boost_mode' trinity/` is **no longer empty** (re-run 2026-06-25:
   `get_betadelta.py`, `run_energy_implicit_phase.py`, `registry.py`, `default.param`). Both the
   `multiplier` AND `theta_target` modes are implemented (`effective_Lloss`/`effective_Lloss_from_params`,
   `get_betadelta.py:334,360`: `multiplier` → `Lleak + fmix·Lcool`; `theta_target` → `max(Lcool+Lleak,
   θ·Lmech)`), declared as `cooling_boost_mode/_fmix/_theta` (`registry.py:348-350`, `default.param`), and
   fed **consistently** to the (β,δ) residual (`get_betadelta.py:473,577`), the `Edot_from_balance` energy
   ODE (`get_betadelta.py:475`), and the 0.95 trigger (≡ `(Lgain−Lloss)/Lgain<0.05`,
   `run_energy_implicit_phase.py:1153/1157`) — default `none` ⇒ byte-identical (§Task B). What remains
   **UNimplemented** is ONLY the density/Da-coupled target `θ_target(Da)` (constant `θ`/`f_mix` only so
   far) — see §Next deliverable. (docs/dev spirit: this anchor was stale within a day; re-verify the grep
   each visit.)
4. **The Stage numbers are a SCREEN, not a forecast** — `data/closure_test.csv` is a *frozen-trajectory*
   reconstruction; boosting cooling lowers `Pb`→`PdV`→**moves blowout itself**, so the fire-times need the
   Tier-2 **live** run (separate processes, matched `t`) before any verdict is trusted (§Hard caveat).

## The question (maintainer, 2026-06-23)

> "Perhaps it's time to add a PdV term into the transition trigger. What was the argument against it?
> If it was that PdV is always deemed too small and negligible, maybe that's not the case now — or not
> the case for larger clusters."

## TL;DR (answers, with evidence below)

1. **"PdV negligible" was never the real argument.** Measured, PdV is **order-unity** — `PdV/Lmech`
   median **0.43–0.55** for *every* normal cloud (table below), not "way too small." So the premise's
   *stated* reason is false: PdV is not negligible.
2. **The actual argument is two-fold:** (a) PdV is **already in the energy evolution** — `Eb(t)` is
   integrated from `Edot_from_balance = Lmech − Lloss − 4πR2²·v2·Pb` (`get_betadelta.py:475`), which
   *includes* the PdV work term; the `cooling_balance` *trigger* deliberately watches only the
   **radiative** ratio `(Lmech − Lloss)/Lmech` because the modelled transition was hypothesised to be
   cooling-driven. (b) Putting PdV *into the trigger* (= the `ebpeak` criterion `Edot_from_balance ≤ 0`)
   **fires nowhere new for normal clouds**, because they are **sub-critical**: even with PdV included,
   net energy keeps growing (Eb grows 1.5–14×10³ monotonically; shipped shadow fires `ebpeak` **0/6**).
3. **The premise is exactly right for large clusters.** At `mCloud=5e9` the cloud is **super-critical**
   — `PdV/Lmech` median **1.42** (PdV *exceeds* Lmech), net energy goes negative, `Eb` peaks and
   collapses (growth **1.014×**). That super-critical regime is precisely where the heavy-cloud crash /
   `ENERGY_COLLAPSED` lives. So a PdV-inclusive trigger (`ebpeak`) **is** the principled handoff *there*.
4. **The machinery already exists.** `ebpeak` shipped as an opt-in, default-off `transition_trigger`
   token (default `cooling_balance`, byte-identical). So this is **not** "add PdV" from scratch — it is
   **"validate the PdV-inclusive trigger toward becoming the default (or the heavy-cloud handoff), and
   measure where the sub→super-critical boundary sits across the science grid."**

## Where PdV lives today (3 sites — verified against current source 2026-06-23)

| site | formula | PdV included? | role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Energy evolution** `get_betadelta.py:475` (`Edot_from_balance`), stored `residual_Edot2_guess` (`run_energy_implicit_phase.py:847-848`) | `Lmech − Lloss − 4πR2²·v2·Pb` | **yes** | how `Eb` actually evolves — PdV already drains the reservoir |
| **`cooling_balance` trigger** `run_energy_implicit_phase.py:1206` | `(Lmech − Lloss)/Lmech < 0.05`, `Lloss = bubble_LTotal (+leak)` | **no** | the default energy→momentum handoff; pure radiative |
| **`ebpeak` trigger** (opt-in) `evaluate_r1_shadow` `:208-210`, shadow `:1166-1190`, drive `:1192-1204` | `Edot_from_balance ≤ 0` | **yes** | "PdV in the trigger" — the net-energy turnover; default-off |

⇒ The maintainer's "add PdV to the trigger" **is** the existing `ebpeak` criterion. It is *not* the same
as "add PdV to the 0.05 cooling ratio" — see §Two readings.

## Evidence: PdV magnitude per regime

Persisted: `data/pdv_regime_budget.csv` (derived from the committed `../cleanroom/data/c0_*_h0.csv` and
`../../failed-large-clouds/data/budget_*.csv`; regenerate with `data/make_pdv_regime_table.py`). Startup
rows dropped; ratios in trinity code units (`PdV = 4πR2²·v2·Pb`, same convention as `Edot_from_balance`).

| config | regime | `PdV/Lmech` med | `PdV/Lmech` max | `Eb` growth | `Eb` monotonic | real in-cloud Eb-peak? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| simple_cluster | normal | 0.460 | 0.646 | 2405× | yes | **no** |
| small_dense_highsfe | normal | 0.464 | 0.658 | 1951× | yes | **no** |
| midrange_pl0 | normal | 0.461 | 0.702 | 2009× | yes | **no** |
| pl2_steep | normal | 0.429 | 0.701 | 2171× | yes | **no** |
| be_sphere | normal | 0.453 | 0.666 | 1715× | yes | **no** |
| large_diffuse_lowsfe | normal | 0.443 | 0.550 | 1499× | yes | **no** (end-of-run blip only) |
| small_1e6 (ctrl) | normal | 0.554 | 1.102 | 13617× | yes | **no** (end-of-run blip only; max>1) |
| **fail_repro** | **heavy 5e9** | **1.423** | 1.561 | **1.014×** | **no** | **yes (row 5, t≈1.53e-3 Myr)** |

Authoritative cross-check (real shipped shadow, segment-wise, not a CSV reconstruction):
`../pt4/r1shadow/r1_shadow_summary.csv` — all 6 normal configs fire **blowout**, `ebpeak` column **blank
(0/6)**; `fail_repro`/`fail_helix` show `n_seg=0` because they collapse in **phase 1a**, *before* the 1b
shadow ever runs. ⚠️ My offline `net_Edot≤0` reconstruction has edge sensitivity (flags a few
end-of-run / startup blips as "fires"); where it disagrees with the shipped shadow, **trust the shadow**.

**Reading:** `PdV/Lmech` is a smooth control parameter. Normal clouds sit ~0.45 (sub-critical, ≪1
margin to the Eb-peak); the 5e9 cloud sits ~1.4 (super-critical). **The whole behavioural fork is which
side of `PdV/Lmech = 1` the cloud lands on.** "PdV negligible" is false everywhere; "PdV decisive" is
true only past the unity crossing.

## Two readings of "add PdV to the trigger" (pick deliberately)

- **(A) `ebpeak` — net-energy turnover `Lmech − Lloss − PdV ≤ 0`.** Threshold = 0 (energy stops
  growing). Principled (it is the physical Eb-peak), already implemented, fires only super-critically.
  Normal clouds: never in-cloud. Heavy clouds: at birth. **This is the recommended meaning.**
- **(B) PdV inside the 0.05 cooling ratio — `(Lmech − Lloss − PdV)/Lmech < 0.05`.** Keeps the legacy
  threshold but moves the operating point by ~`PdV/Lmech ≈ 0.45`. This is **not** physically grounded
  (0.05 was calibrated for a radiative-only ratio) and would fire for normal clouds at an arbitrary
  epoch set by an un-recalibrated constant. **Not recommended** unless re-derived from a model — record
  it only as the literal interpretation of the request, then steer to (A).

## Offline test of reading B — does `(Lmech−Lloss−PdV)/Lmech < 0.05` fire? (2026-06-23 redirect)

The maintainer asked to **test reading B directly** and questioned the point of the standalone `PdV/Lmech`
diagnostic. Both are answered **offline** from the already-committed per-step CSVs — no sims — by
`data/make_combined_trigger_table.py` (→ `data/pdv_combined_trigger.csv`, `pdv_combined_trigger.png`).
Numbers reproduced by an independent recompute on `large_diffuse_lowsfe`/`simple_cluster`/`small_dense_highsfe`.

**The identity that settles the `PdV/Lmech` question.** Write `cool = (Lmech−Lloss)/Lmech` (the shipped
radiative cooling ratio, *no* PdV) and `coolPdV = (Lmech−Lloss−PdV)/Lmech` (the same ratio *with* PdV =
reading B). The with-PdV ratio is *algebraically* the radiative one minus `PdV/Lmech`:

    coolPdV = (Lmech−Lloss−PdV)/Lmech = (Lmech−Lloss)/Lmech − PdV/Lmech = cool − PdV/Lmech

So **`PdV/Lmech` is exactly the offset between the shipped `cooling_balance` trigger and reading B** — its
only role is to quantify how much folding PdV into the ratio loosens the operating point. It is a
*decomposition* diagnostic, **not** a threshold variable; thresholding it against 1 (old Step 1) chases a
sufficient-but-not-necessary proxy (the real crossing is `(Lloss+PdV)/Lmech`, and `Lloss/Lmech` ≈ 0.17–0.29
is not negligible). Equivalently: **reading B = the shipped trigger run at threshold `0.05 + PdV/Lmech ≈ 0.5`**
— a ~10× looser, un-recalibrated constant.

**Result — first-fire of `coolPdV < 0.05` (sustained), vs the shipped `cool < 0.05`:**

| regime | configs | `cool<0.05` fires | `coolPdV<0.05` fires | where / note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| normal | 5/6 cleanroom | 0 | **0** | min `coolPdV` only 0.08–0.15 — never reaches 0.05 |
| normal | large_diffuse_lowsfe | 0 (cool≈0.49 there) | **yes, sustained** | t≈4.76 Myr, **86% through** the run — arbitrary epoch |
| heavy 5e9 | fail_repro | 0 | at birth (row 3, t≈1.5e-3) | `coolPdV<0` immediately, stays `<0` for the physical run |
| ctrl | small_1e6 | 0 | row 0 startup blip (not real) | spurious — recovers to ~0.40 |

**Verdict on reading B (threshold 0.05): it does not behave as a usable trigger.** For 5/6 normal clouds it
is silent (the bubble never stops gaining energy — `coolPdV` bottoms at 0.08–0.15 and recovers); for the 6th
it fires at a late, arbitrary epoch fixed by the mis-set constant, where `cool` is still ≈0.49 (no physical
handoff). The only physically-grounded threshold for the PdV-inclusive ratio is **0** (= `ebpeak`/reading A,
net energy stops growing): normal clouds essentially never cross it in-cloud (`large_diffuse` only oscillates
across 0 at the very end, non-sustained), the 5e9 crosses at birth. **The data confirms reading A over B.**

**Corollary — the real handoff for normal clouds is not energy-budget at all.** Sub-critical clouds fire
*neither* `cool` nor `coolPdV`, so what drives their transition is **blowout** (geometric `R2 > rCloud`),
consistent with the shipped 1b shadow (6/6 blowout, `ebpeak` 0/6). An energy-balance trigger — radiative or
PdV-inclusive — is the wrong family for them; it is decisive only super-critically (the 5e9 pathology).
The figure now marks each config's **blowout point** (`R2 = rCloud`, recovered from `r1_shadow_summary.csv`
since the CSVs export `rCloud` as all-NaN; persisted as `blowout_t`/`cool_at_blowout`/`coolPdV_at_blowout`):
**at blowout the cooling ratio is still 0.30–0.75 (no PdV) / 0.12–0.58 (with PdV)** — i.e. the clouds hand
off to momentum while the energy budget is nowhere near the 0.05 band. That gap is the room a cooling-boost
`θ_cool` would have to close — see next section.

## A more promising direction: PdV **+** a cooling-boost `θ_cool` (2026-06-23 maintainer idea)

> "Maybe a combination of PdV in the cooling **and** a cooling-boost factor `θ_cool`, argued from El-Badry,
> Lancaster, Gronke: our 1D model has no turbulent mixing layers, so we under-count interface cooling.
> `θ_cool` could be a constant from those papers — but shouldn't it couple to the bubble physics?"

**Why it's promising (offline screening — frozen-trajectory, see caveat).** Solve for the constant boost that
makes the PdV-inclusive ratio reach the threshold, `(Lmech − θ_cool·Lloss − PdV)/Lmech = 0.05`, on the
*committed (unboosted)* trajectories:

| config | `f_mix` @blowout **(w/ PdV)** | `f_mix` anywhere (w/ PdV) | `f_mix` anywhere (no PdV) | **`f_mix` @blowout (no PdV) — consistent** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| small_dense_highsfe | 1.10 | 1.04 | 1.33 | **1.36** |
| simple_cluster | 1.12 | 1.06 | 1.41 | **1.42** |
| midrange_pl0 | 1.20 | 1.08 | 1.49 | **1.56** |
| be_sphere | 1.26 | 1.18 | 1.80 | **1.86** |
| pl2_steep | 1.49 | 1.24 | 1.86 | **2.78** |

So **a modest cooling boost `f_mix ≈ 1.4–2.8` (no-PdV trigger; 1.1–1.5 if PdV is folded in) would fire the
energy→momentum handoff right at blowout** for 5/6 normal
clouds — and that boost is *below* the enhancement the mixing-layer literature argues for (El-Badry+19
catastrophic cooling; Lancaster+21 near-complete wind-energy cooling; Gronke & Oh mixing layers). This is the
first candidate that makes a PdV-inclusive trigger physically *and* numerically land where the cloud actually
transitions, instead of never (reading B) or at an arbitrary epoch.

**Constant vs. coupled (the maintainer's question).** Start **constant** — one opt-in float `theta_cool`
(default `1.0`, byte-identical; ponytail-simplest, calibratable, testable). But constant is physically a
placeholder: the mixing-layer luminosity is **not** constant — it scales with the contact-discontinuity area
(`∝R2²`), the shear/turbulent velocity (`∝v2` / hot-gas sound speed), and the mixing-layer cooling function
(Damköhler number; Tan/Oh/Gronke 21, Lancaster fractal-area scaling). The data already argues coupling is
needed: **θ_at_blowout spans 1.1 → 3.1** across configs, so no single constant fires them all at blowout.
Upgrade path: `θ_cool(R2, v2, T)` from the mixing-layer scalings — mark the constant version with a
`ponytail:` comment naming that ceiling.

**Where it plugs in (code map, verified 2026-06-23).** Cooling is computed in
`trinity/bubble_structure/bubble_luminosity.py::_bubble_luminosity()` (three-zone trapezoid integral →
`bubble_LTotal`); **no existing boost knob** (`cool_alpha/beta/delta` are Weaver evolution params, not
efficiency). Add `theta_cool` like `transition_trigger`: `ParamSpec` in `trinity/_input/registry.py` (~:350)
+ a line in `default.param`, then multiply the cooling integrand at the `_bubble_luminosity` site (R2, v[r],
T[r], T_avg, n[r], Pb are all in scope there for a coupled form). Default `1.0` ⇒ byte-identical.

**Recommended sequencing:** (1) opt-in constant `theta_cool` (default 1.0); (2) full-run screening on the edge
configs (`simple_cluster` + `f1edge_{lowdens,hidens}` + a 5e9) to see whether `θ_cool ≈ 1.5–3` makes the
PdV-inclusive trigger fire near blowout *self-consistently*; (3) only then a coupled `θ_cool(R2,v2,T)`.

## Refined plan — unresolved-interface-cooling closure (Paper-II note, 2026-06-24)

Supersedes/sharpens the `θ_cool` sketch above (where my "θ_cool" = the note's **`f_mix`**, a *multiplier*, not a
*fraction*). Driver: the maintainer methods note *"Adding unresolved interface cooling to TRINITY without
double-counting"* + an adversarial physics check (double-count algebra **verified**; `max()` closure is
**single-count by construction** — `Lloss_eff/Lmech = max(Lcool/Lmech, θ)`, never the forbidden
`Lcool/Lmech + θ` — confirmed empirically by `data/make_doublecount_mc.py` (5×10⁵ draws, **0** enter the
double-count region; result `data/doublecount_mc.csv`).

**Framework (note §2–6):**
- Distinguish loss **fraction** `θ ≡ Lloss/Lmech ∈ [0,1]` (a target/output) from loss **multiplier**
  `f_mix ≡ Lcool_mix/Lcool_smooth ≥ 1` (a knob on the resolved integral). One symbol must not name two operations.
- **Never double-count.** TRINITY already subtracts the explicit `Lcool`; adding a `(1−θ)Lmech` input-rescale on
  top removes `2θLmech` at consistency (net drive negative for θ>½). The correction must **add only the missing
  part**, never rescale `Lmech`.
- **Boost the LOSS, keep the trigger form.** Note's trigger is `(Lmech − Lloss_eff)/Lmech < 0.05`, with PdV in
  the **ODE only** (not the trigger). Physics: PdV is *reversible* (recoverable as shell momentum), cooling is
  *irreversible* — fire on the irreversible channel. ⇒ **This is distinct from reading B** (which put PdV in the
  trigger); the note instead fixes the cooling *magnitude*.

**Closures under test (default `none` ⇒ byte-identical):**
- `multiplier`: `Lloss_eff = Lleak + f_mix·Lcool` — sweep probe; does *not* change the T-profile or evaporation
  (its ceiling — a scalar can't back-react on the evaporative mass flux).
- `theta_target`: `Lloss_eff = max(Lcool+Lleak, θ_target·Lmech)` — double-count-free **iff** the two terms are
  estimators of the *same* sink (they are: `θ_target·Lmech` is a target on the resolved-cooling fraction). Tops
  up to the target, switches OFF where resolved cooling already exceeds it.
- `kappa_eff` (endgame, out of shadow scope): `κ_eff = max(κ_Spitzer, κ_mix)`, `κ_mix ~ ρ cp D_turb`,
  `D_turb ~ λ δv ~ R2 v2`. The only honest form — couples cooling↔evaporation and can reproduce El-Badry's 3–30×
  evaporation suppression; scalar closures cannot. The scalars are calibration probes that point here.

**Consistency contract (note §Code-level):** one helper feeds the β–δ residual, the energy ODE, *and* the
trigger — the same `Lloss_eff`. Shadow ⇒ reconstruct the trigger ratio only; production ⇒ this is the gate.

**Staged shadow / non-disruptive test — all 8 configs (6 normal + fail_repro + fail_helix):**
- **Stage 1 — Gate audit** (note's "check the gate first"): per-segment {active triggers, Lcool, Lleak, Lmech,
  PdV, β, δ, residual, baseline ratios}. Confirm cooling-balance is *active but never trips* (ratio stays high),
  not a gate bug. Plot: baseline ratio trajectories + blowout markers.
- **Stage 2 — Closure sweep (FROZEN trajectory):** both closures over `f_mix ∈ {1,1.5,2,3,5,10,30}` and
  `θ_target ∈ {0.3,0.5,0.7,0.8,0.9,0.95}` (ceiling **θ_max=0.95** at GMC-core n — the El-Badry density scaling is
  an *extrapolation* there). Per (config × value): does the note `cb` trigger fire? sustained? `t_fire/R2_fire`
  vs blowout? Plots: (a) per-config ratios under increasing boost; (b) fire-vs-blowout heatmap (config × value),
  multiplier and theta_target.
- **Stage 3 — Double-count / consistency check:** instantiate the note's Fig 1 with real per-config `Lcool/Lmech`;
  show the closures stay on the single-count line and never enter the `2θ` region. Plot: that diagram, 8 configs placed.
- **Stage 4 — Which is good:** rank by — fires near blowout for normal clouds (not birth, not never), preserves
  heavy-cloud collapse, double-count-safe, and whether the firing value is ~constant across configs (⇒ a constant
  knob suffices) or spreads (⇒ needs the Da/κ_eff coupling). Recommend a candidate + the gated **Tier-2 full run**
  (disruptive: apply `Lloss_eff` in residual+ODE+trigger, separate processes, matched `t`) as the NEXT step.

**Hard caveat (rule 5 + physics-check §5.1): the shadow only SCREENS.** Boosting cooling lowers Pb → lowers PdV →
moves blowout itself; the unboosted trajectory is *not* the state the boosted ODE visits. Shadow fire-times are a
screen, **not predictions** — the verdict needs Tier-2.

### Next deliverable (PRIMARY, 2026-06-25) — the coupled `θ_target(Da)`, not a constant θ

> **STATUS 2026-06-25: `θ_target(Da)` was TESTED and is REFUTED** — Step A (offline proxy) and Step A′ (the
> gate-validated real-Da replay) are **both NO-GO**. The rationale below is kept as the motivating argument;
> the revised forward plan is in **"Outcome & pivot"** at the end of this section.

This was previously filed as a "coupled upgrade to **record (not implement)**". As of 2026-06-25 it is
promoted to the **primary next deliverable**, because the analysis below shows a *constant* target is not a
real contribution — only a trajectory-varying `θ_target(Da)` is.

**The constant-θ / `fmix_no_pdv` calibration is DEGENERATE with the existing 0.95 trigger.** The
"consistent" screen solves `f_mix(n) = 0.95/(L_cool/L_mech)` at blowout (§Cooling-boost table last column)
— but the 0.95 there is *the trigger threshold itself* (the trigger is `(Lgain−Lloss)/Lgain<0.05` ⇒ fire
when `Lloss/Lmech` reaches 0.95). So `f_mix(n)=0.95/(L_cool/L_mech)` is **bit-identical to the `fmix_no_pdv`
column by construction** — it just restates "boost the resolved loss until it hits the threshold." A flat
literature `θ_lit≈0.95` therefore adds **nothing quantitative**: it lands exactly where the un-boosted
trigger already would if cooling reached 0.95. **A constant target is not a real contribution.**

**The only non-degenerate upgrade is a target that VARIES along the trajectory:** `θ_target(Da)`,
`Da = t_turb/t_cool` (Damköhler number) — density- AND time-dependent. Because it moves with the state, it
absorbs the density/SFE/stage confound that the edge configs cannot separate (recall θ_at_blowout spans
1.1→3.1 across the grid — no constant fires them all). Functional form to validate:
`θ_target(state) = θ_max · Da/(1+Da)` — recovers El-Badry (high-Da, interface-dominated) and Weaver
(low-Da, energy-driven) limits from one dimensionless ratio.

**Honest prerequisite scoping (verified against source 2026-06-25).** Production computes **none** of the Da
ingredients yet: `grep -rn 't_turb\|Damk' trinity/` is **empty** (2026-06-25), and there is **no standalone
interface density `n_int`** (only `n_interm`, the intermediate-zone density already used in the cooling
integral, `bubble_luminosity.py:761`). The closest existing proxy is the **OFFLINE** `F2_tcool_tdyn =
(Eb/Lloss)/(R2/v2)` in `docs/dev/transition/harness/harvest.py:14,110-112` — diagnostic only, and
previously judged a **red herring** (it fires ~60× too early). So the deliverable scope is:
  1. **Build Da from LIVE solver state** — the interface `n,T` already used in the cooling integral
     (`bubble_luminosity.py`), with `R2/v2` as the turbulent-timescale proxy (`t_turb ~ λ/δv ~ R2/v2`).
  2. **Choose/validate the `θ_max·Da/(1+Da)` form** against the edge configs (does it fire near blowout
     self-consistently across the density grid where a constant cannot?).
  3. **Gate it byte-identical-when-off** exactly like the existing cooling-boost knob (§Task B): a new
     `theta_target` sub-mode/parameterisation that reduces to the current behaviour when disabled.

(This stays PLAN/scoping prose — it is the *next step*, not an implementation.)

#### Step A result (2026-06-25) — offline Da-screen: NO-GO for the `(R2/v2)·Pb` proxy → the real Da needs a replay

`data/make_da_screen.py` (+ `data/da_screen.csv`, `da_screen.png`) screened the **offline** Da target on the
6 cleanroom trajectories. Under a fixed characteristic interface T_int, `Da` collapses to
`Da_shape = (R2/v2)·Pb` (units absorbed by a swept normalization ⇒ a **unit-independent structural test**).
Result: **no single normalization fires the grid at blowout** — two failure modes:
- `Da_shape`@blowout is **non-monotonic in nCore and spans ~14×** (`pl2_steep` 1e5 = 4222, *below*
  `large_diffuse` 1e2 = 4601; `simple_cluster` 1e5 = 54690). The `θ_max·Da/(1+Da)=0.95` crossing is at one
  fixed Da, so it can coincide with blowout only if `Da_shape`@blowout were ~constant — it is not.
- `Da_shape` is large early (high Pb at small R2) → any C that pushes the diffuse configs to θ≈0.95 fires the
  dense configs at **birth** (fmb ≈ −0.85). 0/6 valid sustained fires anywhere on the C×θ_max grid.
The bulk `Da_bulk = 1/F2` baseline fires far before blowout (confirms the red herring). Empirical θ/(1−θ)@
blowout rises only ~6.9× over 4 decades (slope ~0.18) — **shallower than √n**; 6 points + confounded SFE
cannot decide √n (El-Badry) vs linear-n (Da).

**What it rules out / does NOT.** It rules out the *offline shortcut* (Da from frozen `(R2/v2)·Pb`), because
that combination collapses away the per-config/per-time `T_int` and `Λ` — the very quantities that could
separate the configs. It does **not** rule out `θ_target(Da)` itself; the proper Da is untested. So step 2
is revised:

  **2′. Compute the REAL Da by REPLAY (no full re-runs).** For each row of the committed cleanroom
  trajectories, re-invoke trinity's interface calc (`bubble_luminosity.py` → `T_int(r)`, `Λ(T_int)`,
  `n_int = Pb/(k_B T_int)` ⇒ `t_cool,int = (3/2)k_B T_int/(n_int Λ)`) to get `Da = (R2/v2)/t_cool,int`, then
  re-run `make_da_screen.py` on the real Da. **GO** ⇒ implement (step 3). **NO-GO on the real Da** ⇒
  `θ_target(Da)` is the wrong closure — revisit (the shallow θ(n) may mean the constant target / degeneracy
  is the honest end state, or a different functional form is needed). The replay reuses production code on
  frozen states (CLAUDE.md rule 5) — cheaper and more faithful than the proxy or a full re-run.

#### Step A′ result (2026-06-25) — real-Da replay: gate PASS, verdict **NO-GO** (`θ_target(Da)` refuted)

`data/make_da_replay.py` (+ `data/da_replay.csv`, `da_replay.png`) recomputed the REAL Da by replaying
trinity's own interface cooling on the 6 cleanroom trajectories. **Validation gate PASSES:** the replay
reproduces the logged `bubble_Lloss` to ≤3.9e-5 (tol 1e-3) and the interface zone `L3` is **bit-identical**
(reldiff 0) — so the real Da is trustworthy, not a proxy artifact. Verdict: **NO-GO** — 0/6 valid sustained
fires under any single `(C, θ_max)`. Three decisive reasons:
- **`T_int` is ~constant across all configs (~21.4–22.6 kK).** The radiative interface sits where Λ peaks,
  independent of cloud, so `Da ≈ (R2/v2)·Pb·Λ(T_int)/const ≈ proxy × const` — the offline proxy was a *good*
  approximation and its NO-GO carries over.
- **Real `Da`@blowout is still NON-monotonic in nCore** (pl2_steep 1e5 = 4.7e4, *below* large_diffuse 1e2 =
  5.6e4 and midrange 1e4 = 4.2e5; spread 14×). No monotonic `θ(Da)` can order the configs by density.
- **`Da ≫ 1` everywhere at blowout (4.7e4–6.6e5)**, so `θ_max·Da/(1+Da)` **saturates to ~θ_max for every
  config** → collapses to a *constant* target → exactly the degeneracy that adds nothing (density-law
  exponent p≈0, flat).

#### Outcome & pivot (2026-06-25)

A cooling-magnitude knob — constant **or** `Da`-coupled — is **not** what triggers the energy→momentum
transition for these clouds. At blowout the resolved loss ratio is only 0.25–0.70 (well short of 0.95), and
`Da` neither orders by density nor discriminates. Convergent, data-backed conclusion (matches the methods
note's closing nuance): **for normal clouds the operative handoff is geometric blowout (`R2=rCloud`), not
cooling balance.** Revised program:
  1. **Drop `θ_target(Da)` as a trigger mechanism** (refuted by a gate-validated replay).
  2. **Treat blowout as the transition trigger for normal clouds** — which TRINITY's default already does
     (cooling_balance rarely fires first; the momentum phase begins at blowout). The "runs never transition"
     symptom is the *cooling magnitude*, not the trigger.
  3. **Use the cooling boost (constant `θ`≈0.9–0.99 from literature, via the existing `theta_target` mode)
     to correct cooling MAGNITUDE** so `Eb, Pb, R2, v2`, and evaporation are right *through* the blowout
     handoff — not to fire it. (`κ_eff`, the faithful interface re-derivation, stays the long-term endgame —
     feasibility + scope in **`KAPPA_EFF_SCOPING.md`**: possible/bounded, the `(β,δ)` solver survives, crux is
     the cooling↔evaporation decoupling a naive post-hoc sink already stalled on.)
  4. **Confirm with live matched-`t` runs** that the magnitude correction doesn't distort the trajectory.

**Data:** 7/8 offline-reconstructable (6 cleanroom h0 + `budget_fail_repro`); `fail_helix` has only logs (collapses
in phase 1a) → needs the in-solver shadow run. Artifacts: `data/make_closure_test.py`, `data/closure_test.csv`,
`closure_stage{1..4}*.png`.

### Stage results (2026-06-24 — FROZEN-TRAJECTORY SCREEN; bounds the knob, does not forecast)
1. **`cb` trigger (boost loss, no PdV) is the right family for normal clouds:** `f_mix ≈ 1.5–2` brings their cooling
   ratio into the band near the transition. Supersedes reading B (don't put PdV in the trigger; fix the cooling).
2. **A constant knob can't place the transition at blowout across the grid (Stage 2 heatmap).** At `f_mix≈2`,
   compact/dense fire *at* blowout (`simple_cluster −0.07`, `small_dense −0.01` Myr, at `f_mix=2`) but diffuse fire *well before*
   (`pl2_steep −0.81`, `large_diffuse −1.3…−3.65`). Density-ordered (dense already cool: `Lcool/Lmech≈0.7` at
   blowout; diffuse `≈0.25`) ⇒ **the data argues for the coupled `θ_target(Da)`/`κ_eff` form, not a constant.**
3. **`theta_target` constant is blunt:** fires nowhere below 0.95, ~at birth at 0.95 — use only via the
   density-dependent `θ_target(n)` model + ceiling. The **multiplier `f_mix` is the better probe.**
4. **Heavy clouds are complementary, not covered by cooling:** `fail_repro` never fires `cb` even at `f_mix=30`
   (`Lcool/Lmech≈0.01`, PdV-dominated) ⇒ heavy clouds need the **PdV/ebpeak handoff**, normal clouds the **cooling
   boost**. Clean sub-/super-critical regime split.
5. **Double-count check (Stage 3):** every config sits on the single-count line; the closures never enter `2θ`.

**Next (gated, disruptive — NOT in the shadow):** wire an opt-in `cooling_boost_mode ∈ {none,multiplier,theta_target}`
feeding the β–δ residual + ODE + trigger *consistently* (note §Code-level), run ≥2 edge configs **live** (separate
processes, matched `t`) to test self-consistency vs the frozen screen; add the in-solver 1a/1b shadow to cover
`fail_helix`. Then decide constant-vs-`θ_target(Da)` from the live spread.

## Task B — opt-in `cooling_boost_mode` wiring (2026-06-24, gated, byte-identical when off)

The maintainer authorised wiring the closure for a **live** test. Built exactly as the note's §Code-level
rule demands — **one helper, three sites, default off ⇒ byte-identical**.

**Implementation (production):**
- `effective_Lloss(mode, fmix, theta_target, Lcool, Lleak, Lmech)` + the params wrapper
  `effective_Lloss_from_params(...)` in `get_betadelta.py` (after `compute_R1_Pb`). Modes: `none` →
  `Lcool+Lleak` (byte-identical); `multiplier` → `Lleak + fmix·Lcool`; `theta_target` →
  `max(Lcool+Lleak, θ·Lmech)`. An unrecognised token falls back to the resolved loss (a typo can't
  perturb a run).
- Fed **consistently** to all three sites (the note's consistency contract): the β–δ residual
  (`get_residual_pure`), the `Edot_from_balance` ODE/detail path (`get_residual_detailed`), and the
  `cooling_balance` trigger (`run_energy_implicit_phase.py` ~:1147). Same `Lloss_eff` everywhere.
- 3 params (`cooling_boost_mode`/`_fmix`/`_theta`) in `registry.py` + `default.param`, mirroring
  `transition_trigger`'s `exclude_from_snapshot=True, run_const=True` — drops them from
  `dictionary.jsonl` (`dictionary.py:254/616`), routes them to `metadata.json` → default run byte-identical.

**Gate (rule 5 — real runs, separate processes; `simple_cluster` mCloud=1e5 sfe=0.3):**
- **`none` byte-identical to HEAD through the active-cooling region** (snapshots 1–128; resolved cooling
  activates at snap 98 — `bubble_Lloss` is NaN before that, so the test only bites past 98, and PASSES
  there). Provable too: the `none` branch is the identical `Lcool+Lleak` float op the original ran.
- **`multiplier f=2` diverges at snapshot 99** — the *first* active-cooling step — confirming the boost
  is genuinely live; `metadata.json` confirms the knobs load.
- ✅ ruff F-rules clean; ✅ 20/20 tests (`test_cooling_boost.py` 6 + `test_r1_shadow.py` 14).

**Still a SCREEN, not a forecast (anchor 4):** the gate proves the wiring is correct and *safe*; it does
**not** yet replace the frozen screen. NEXT: matched-`t` edge-config live runs (`simple_cluster` +
`f1edge_{lowdens,hidens}` + a 5e9), boosted vs unboosted in separate processes, to settle
constant-`f_mix` vs coupled `θ_target(Da)`.

## Plan & test design (rule-5 ladder — this is a risky/iterative/outward-facing change)

The change touches the solver's phase-handoff and the late-time **fate** outputs, and is a
**default-flip** candidate ⇒ full ladder, no rung skipped because an earlier passed.

### Step 0 — Gate first (define "equivalent" before any edit)
- **Hard gate:** any default change must be **byte-identical** (`dictionary.jsonl` sha256) on every
  config that *already* transitions via `cooling_balance`. (Under `hybr` that set is currently empty —
  0/6 fire — but legacy/clamped-β configs and any future-cooled model still use it, so the gate stands.)
- **Continuity gate:** at the handoff, `Eb / R2 / v2 / P_drive` must enter phase 1c no more
  discontinuously than the `cooling_balance` handoff does. **The heavy-cloud Eb-peak is the make-or-break
  case** (reservoir grew only 1.014× → 1c may reject a near-empty bubble).
- Pass/fail bars + `f_ret` targets written here *before* editing.

### Step 1 — Decisive new measurement: combined-ratio first-fire across the science grid
> **2026-06-23 redirect (supersedes the old "map `PdV/Lmech = 1`" framing).** The decision-relevant
> quantity is the **combined ratio** `coolPdV = cool − PdV/Lmech`, not `PdV/Lmech` alone (see §Offline test
> for why `PdV/Lmech=1` is a sufficient-but-not-necessary proxy). The offline first-cut is **done** above;
> the open question is the *in-process, authoritative* version. Still record max/median `PdV/Lmech` per cell,
> but only as the **offset diagnostic** that explains the `coolPdV`–`cool` gap — not as the boundary to map.

The open scientific question behind the maintainer's premise: **does any *realistic* cluster (not just
the 5e9 pathology) approach super-critical?** If the boundary sits far above the science range, the PdV
trigger is an edge-case guard; if real sweeps straddle it, it is a default-relevant correctness fix.
- Sweep `mCloud × sfe × density-profile` (reuse `../../failed-large-clouds/harness/params/` +
  `../cleanroom/configs/`), each run in a **separate process**, with the **shadow active** (default
  trigger ⇒ byte-identical), harvesting `shadow_R1_1b.csv` + per-segment `PdV/Lmech`.
- Record max/median `PdV/Lmech` and first `ebpeak`/`blowout` epoch per cell → a contour of the
  sub→super-critical boundary. Persist as `data/pdv_boundary_grid.csv` + a figure.
- **Note the phase-1a gap:** the 5e9 Eb-peak is a **phase-1a** event invisible to the 1b shadow
  (`r1_shadow_summary.csv` `n_seg=0`). To measure the heavy end, add a **read-only 1a shadow** of
  `Edot_from_balance` (mirror of the 1b shadow; logging only, no break) — itself a gated micro-change.

### Step 2 — Baseline capture
`git show HEAD` trajectories (Eb/R2/v2/P_drive/end-code) on the edge set: `simple_cluster` +
`../../performance/f1edge_{lowdens,hidens}*.param` + a 5e9 point. Saved here so "before" survives.

### Step 3 — Equivalence / behaviour gate
- **Per-call (cheap, necessary, not sufficient):** unit-test `evaluate_r1_shadow` / `r1_transition_decision`
  truth tables already exist (`test/test_r1_shadow.py`, 14/14) — extend with the 1a-shadow analogue.
- **Full-run, stiffest regimes, separate processes, matched `t`:** run `transition_trigger=ebpeak`,
  `blowout`, and `r1` (=both) on all 6 normal configs + ≥1 heavy 5e9, compared against the `cooling_balance`
  baseline at matched simulation time. Check: (i) run completes; (ii) **phase-1c continuity** of the four
  state vars; (iii) terminal fate (momentum, final R2, stop code) is physically defensible.

### Step 4 — Apply the smallest diff that passes
Likely candidates, smallest first: (a) add the **1a Eb-peak shadow** (read-only); (b) if Step 3 shows
the heavy handoff is clean, wire **`ebpeak` as the heavy-cloud handoff** replacing `ENERGY_COLLAPSED`
(opt-in first); (c) only if Step 1 shows science-grid relevance, propose a **default flip** to
`cooling_balance,blowout` (and/or `ebpeak`) — additive, so it never perturbs a run that already fires.

### Step 5 — Re-verify
Continuity + byte-identity gate again, full `pytest` (`-m "not stress"`), ruff F-rules.

### Step 6 — Persist
Boundary grid CSV + figure, baseline/edge trajectories, and the handoff-continuity comparison committed
under `docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/` with the exact config + command for each.

## Open questions / risks
- **Heavy handoff viability:** the 5e9 Eb-peak hands off a *stillborn* reservoir (1.014× growth) — does
  phase 1c accept it, or is `ENERGY_COLLAPSED` still the honest end? (pt4 H3/H4 lean toward "needs
  momentum continuation or added cooling," not just a trigger relabel.)
- **Does reading (B) ever make sense?** Only if a recalibrated, model-derived threshold replaces 0.05.
  Default to (A).
- **Boundary location:** if no realistic cluster reaches `PdV/Lmech > 1`, the PdV trigger is a guard for
  the pathological edge, not a science-sweep correctness fix — that changes the priority of a default flip.

### In-solver shadow insertion point (code map, verified 2026-06-23)
If/when the authoritative in-process confirmation of reading B is wanted (the offline reconstruction has the
end-of-run/startup edge sensitivity the §Evidence cross-check warns about), it is a ~5-line **read-only**
add at `trinity/phase1b_energy_implicit/run_energy_implicit_phase.py:1166`, right after the existing
`ebpeak` shadow eval — `Lgain` (=`Lmech_total`), `Lloss`, `R2`, `v2`, `params['Pb'].value` and
`betadelta_result.Edot_from_balance` are all in scope there. Add `combined_ratio = (Lgain − Lloss −
4πR2²·v2·Pb)/Lgain` (= `edot_balance/Lgain`) and a `combined_ratio` / `combined_ratio_fired` column to the
`shadow_rows` dict (the same block already logs `cooling_ratio` and `edot_balance` → `shadow_R1_1b.csv`).
Byte-identical (logging only); extend the `test/test_r1_shadow.py` truth table (14 tests). **Lower priority
given the offline verdict** — it confirms, it does not change, the reading-B finding.

## Artifacts
- `data/fmix_table.csv` (+ builder `data/make_fmix_table.py`) — the methods-note **Table 2**, now
  script-emitted from `pdv_combined_trigger.csv`. Both trigger conventions (with-PdV screen vs the
  consistent no-PdV recommended trigger); headline `f_mix ≈ 1.4–2.8`. Regenerate: `python
  docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/data/make_fmix_table.py`.
- `data/doublecount_mc.csv` (+ builder `data/make_doublecount_mc.py`) — the 5×10⁵-draw Monte-Carlo that
  backs the note's double-count-free claim (0 draws enter the `2θ` region; single-count by construction).
- `data/closure_test.csv` (+ builder `data/make_closure_test.py`, figures `data/make_closure_plots.py` →
  `closure_stage{1..4}*.png`) — the §Refined-plan **8-config staged shadow** (frozen-trajectory screen;
  §Stage results). Regenerate: `python docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/data/make_closure_test.py && python
  docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/data/make_closure_plots.py`.
- `data/pdv_combined_trigger.csv` (+ `data/make_combined_trigger_table.py`, figure `pdv_combined_trigger.png`)
  — the §Offline-test reading-B first-fire table. Regenerate: `python docs/dev/transition/pdv-trigger/data/make_combined_trigger_table.py`.
- `data/pdv_regime_budget.csv` (+ `data/make_pdv_regime_table.py`) — the §Evidence table.
- Upstream (committed): `../cleanroom/data/c0_*_h0.csv`, `../../failed-large-clouds/data/budget_*.csv`,
  `../pt4/r1shadow/r1_shadow_summary.csv`.
