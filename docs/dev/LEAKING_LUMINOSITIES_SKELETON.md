# Phase plan — Geometry-set covering-fraction leak (`coverFraction`)

> **Status (v2): Phase A–C drafted on branch `feature/add-Cf`.** The energy leak is wired;
> the **mass sink (Phase D) and X-ray/photon work (Phase G) are NOT implemented** and several
> edge cases are open (§7). Decisions Q1–Q4 are resolved per the leakage spec v2 (its §S5).
> Line numbers drift — locate edits by function and quoted strings, not by number (spec S6).

## 0. Scope & invariants

- **One new input**: `coverFraction` (`Cf`), default `1.0`, validated `0 < Cf ≤ 1`.
- **Hard invariant (merge gate)**: `Cf = 1 ⇒ Lleak ≡ 0`, byte-for-byte identical trajectory.
  Verified: `coverFraction` loads as *exactly* `1.0`, the helper's `Cf ≥ 1` guard returns
  `0.0`, and `Ed = … − 0.0` is bit-identical to the old `… − 0`.
- **Branch**: `feature/add-Cf` (renamed from the session branch; the spec's suggested
  `rosette/cf-leak`/`feature/leaking-luminosities` names were superseded by the user).
- This still edits the core energy equation ⇒ **Joel sign-off before merge**.

## 1. What is implemented in A–C (verified against the code)

| File · symbol | Change |
|---|---|
| `bubble_structure/get_bubbleParams.py` · **`get_leak_luminosity`** (new) | `Lleak = γ/(γ−1)·(1−Cf)·4πR2²·Pb·c_sound`. Returns `0.0` when `Cf≥1`, `Pb≤0`, or `c_sound≤0` (self-limiting; never injects energy). Code units throughout — no conversion. |
| `phase1_energy/energy_phase_ODEs.py` · `ODESnapshot` | added frozen fields `coverFraction`, `c_sound` (hot, from `bubble_Tavg`); populated in `create_ODE_snapshot`. |
| …  · `get_ODE_Edot_pure` | replaced `L_leak = 0` placeholder with a live call (live `press_bubble`,`R2`; frozen `Cf`,`c_sound`). |
| …  · `ODEResult` + `compute_derived_quantities` | new `bubble_Leak` field, computed and returned (pure RHS can't write; this is the recording path). |
| `phase1_energy/run_energy_phase.py` | writes `ode_result.bubble_Leak → params['bubble_Leak']`. |
| `phase1b_energy_implicit/run_energy_implicit_phase.py` | sets `params['bubble_Leak']` from the helper **before** `solve_betadelta_pure` (which already sums it into `L_loss`). 1-step frozen `Pb`/`c_sound`, consistent with the phase's slowly-varying `Lloss` treatment. |
| `_input/registry.py` | new `coverFraction` `ParamSpec` (input_physical, run_const, default `1.0`) + `_validate_coverFraction` (0<Cf≤1). |
| `_input/default.param` | regenerated via `python -m tools.gen_default_param --write`. |
| `test/test_cf_leak.py` (new) | helper correctness, `Cf=1`→0, guards, monotonicity, validator, and the **unit-landing** assertion (`Pb·cs·R²` → `Msun·pc²/Myr³` with no hidden factor). |

`c_sound` provenance: `run_energy_phase.py` sets `params['c_sound'] = get_soundspeed(Tavg, params)`
(Tavg = `bubble_data.bubble_Tavg`) **before** the snapshot is built, so the snapshot's `c_sound`
is the hot-bubble value the spec requires. The implicit phase mirrors this (`get_soundspeed(bubble_Tavg)`).

## 2. Resolved decisions (spec v2 §S5)

- **Q1 — transition double-count: none; keep one `Lleak`.** The transition forms
  `Ėb = min(energy-balance, −Eb/(R2/cs))` — a *selector*, not a sum — so the leak entering the
  energy-balance branch can't double-count with the sound-crossing drain. No phase gate on
  `Lleak`. **Do not** turn the `min` into a sum. (For `Cf~0.9–0.99` the sound-crossing term
  usually wins the `min`; the leak's real effect is earlier — lowering `Eb` in energy/implicit
  and bringing the transition on sooner, at smaller `Rb`.)
- **Q2 — mass sink at the density level (Phase D, not yet done).** Net flux
  `Ṁb = Ṁevap − Ṁleak`. Impose on the retained mass / the density fed to `Lcool` and the X-ray —
  **not** on `bubble_dMdt` (the Weaver conduction BC). Because `Pb` is energy-closed, the mass
  sink does not move `Rb`; it fixes `Lcool`, the X-ray, and the hot-gas mass. Option A
  (density-level reduction) first; Option B (an explicitly tracked `Mb`) only if the X-ray needs
  a handle independent of the energy sink.
- **Q3 — covering-fraction enthalpy leak with the mass sink** (not the constant-θ proxy). ✅ energy half done.
- **Q4 — photon coupling `fleak = 1−Cf`**, same geometry, at the CLOUDY post-processing stage. Not in the ODE.

## 3. Phase status

```
A. Plumbing (param, snapshot, output, helper) ........ DRAFTED
B. Phase diagnosis at stellar age (read-only go/no-go)  PENDING run (needs full trajectory; see §6)
C. Energy leak apply (explicit RHS + implicit) ....... DRAFTED
D. Mass sink (Q2, density level) ..................... NOT STARTED — see open edge cases §7
E. Transition: nothing to do (Q1 = selector) ........ N/A by decision
F. Floor / velocity characterization (S4.5) ......... PENDING (needs Cf<1 runs)
G. Photon budget (Q4) + X-ray calibration (S4.6) .... NOT STARTED (no L_X in code; CLOUDY stage)
```

## 4. Verification status

- `test/test_cf_leak.py`: **16/16 pass**.
- Codegen gate `tools.gen_default_param --check`: **in sync**.
- Full suite: **369 pass**; the one failure is `test_run_smoke.py::test_quickstart_completes_cleanly`,
  a `MonotonicError` in the bubble-structure integrator that occurs **before** any leak code runs
  in the loop and reproduces independently of `Cf`. Treated as pre-existing integrator flakiness
  (the repo's own `requirements.txt` documents this class of non-deterministic breakage); see §6
  for the determinism probe.

## 5. Remaining gates to run (S4)

1. **Regression (merge gate)** — `Cf=1` reproduces `Rb(t)`,`Eb(t)`,X-ray. Holds by construction (guard returns 0.0).
2. **Phase diagnosis** — read the phase at the stellar age in an unmodified rosette run; energy/transition ⇒ leak is the right lever.
3. **Monotonicity** — `Cf ∈ {1.0,0.95,0.9}` ⇒ smaller `Rb`,`Eb`; `bubble_Leak` positive.
4. **Energy/mass audit** — needs Phase D for the mass half.
5. **Floor/velocity** — smallest stable `Cf`: `Rb` floors near the momentum-limited radius (>7 pc), `vb` ≪ observed.
6. **X-ray consistency** — needs Phase G.

## 6. Notes for whoever runs the trajectories

- A full rosette trajectory needs SPS + non-CIE cooling tables (`lib/default/opiate/`, `SB99_rotation=1`).
- The bubble-structure integrator is numerically touchy (`MonotonicError`, "excess work" warnings) at
  a knife-edge that multithreaded BLAS can flip run-to-run. If the smoke test is flaky, pin
  `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_NUM_THREADS=1` to test determinism before blaming a code change.

## 7. Open edge cases / unanswered questions (carry into Phase D and review)

These are **not** handled by the A–C draft and need decisions:

1. **`Mb = 0` (or → 0) with `Ṁb < 0`.** When the mass sink (Phase D) drives the retained hot-gas
   mass to zero while `Ṁleak` still wants to remove mass, the density fed to `Lcool`/X-ray must not
   go negative or divide-by-zero (`n = Pb/(2 k_B T)` already shows `divide by zero` warnings in the
   structure code). Need a floor (`Mb ≥ 0`, leak mass-rate clamped to available mass per step) and a
   decision on what "empty hot bubble" means physically (does the leak then switch off? does `Pb`
   still come from `Eb/V`?). **Open.**
2. **`Eb` depressurising within one RK step at small `Cf`.** `Lleak ∝ Pb ∝ Eb` self-limits, but a
   large `(1−Cf)` with the short hot-gas `cs` (~10⁴ yr leak time) can overshoot `Eb` toward/below 0
   inside a single step and stress the integrator. Current guard zeroes the leak at `Pb ≤ 0`, but the
   step that crosses zero is not substepped. Recommended usable range `Cf ~ 0.9–0.99` (documented on
   the param). **Open: do we need an Eb floor / adaptive substep?**
3. **Evaporation scaling by `Cf`.** Only the *intact* fraction of the wall should evaporate, so
   arguably `Ṁevap → Cf·Ṁevap`. The spec calls this a secondary effect to decide with Joel; the draft
   does **not** touch `bubble_dMdt`. **Open.**
4. **Implicit-phase 1-step staleness.** `bubble_Leak` there uses the previous segment's `Pb`,`c_sound`.
   Fine for slowly-varying conditions; revisit if `Cf` is small enough that the leak changes fast within a segment.
5. **X-ray / retained-pressure calibration target is absent** (no `L_X` in the code). Calibration of
   `Cf` to the Townsley plasma pressure (spec §calib) lands in CLOUDY post-processing — out of scope for A–D.
6. **Transition `min` vs leak interaction at `Cf < ~0.8`.** By Q1 this is correct-by-construction, but
   it has not been exercised numerically; confirm continuity of `Ėb` across the transition entry once Cf<1 runs exist.
